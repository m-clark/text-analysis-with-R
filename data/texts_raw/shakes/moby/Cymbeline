SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.

Enter two Gentlemen


First Gentleman

You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloodsNo more obey the heavens than our courtiersStill seem as does the king.

Second Gentleman

But what's the matter?

First Gentleman

His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whomHe purposed to his wife's sole son--a widowThat late he married--hath referr'd herselfUnto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: allIs outward sorrow; though I think the kingBe touch'd at very heart.

Second Gentleman

None but the king?

First Gentleman

He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,That most desired the match; but not a courtier,Although they wear their faces to the bentOf the king's look's, hath a heart that is notGlad at the thing they scowl at.

Second Gentleman

And why so?

First Gentleman

He that hath miss'd the princess is a thingToo bad for bad report: and he that hath her--I mean, that married her, alack, good man!And therefore banish'd--is a creature suchAs, to seek through the regions of the earthFor one his like, there would be something failingIn him that should compare. I do not thinkSo fair an outward and such stuff withinEndows a man but he.

Second Gentleman

You speak him far.

First Gentleman

I do extend him, sir, within himself,Crush him together rather than unfoldHis measure duly.

Second Gentleman

                  What's his name and birth?

First Gentleman

I cannot delve him to the root: his fatherWas call'd Sicilius, who did join his honourAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,But had his titles by Tenantius whomHe served with glory and admired success,So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;And had, besides this gentleman in question,Two other sons, who in the wars o' the timeDied with their swords in hand; for whichtheir father,Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrowThat he quit being, and his gentle lady,Big of this gentleman our theme, deceasedAs he was born. The king he takes the babeTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,Puts to him all the learnings that his timeCould make him the receiver of; which he took,As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,A sample to the youngest, to the more matureA glass that feated them, and to the graverA child that guided dotards; to his mistress,For whom he now is banish'd, her own priceProclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;By her election may be truly readWhat kind of man he is.

Second Gentleman

I honour himEven out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,Is she sole child to the king?

First Gentleman

His only child.He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nurseryWere stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledgeWhich way they went.

Second Gentleman

How long is this ago?

First Gentleman

Some twenty years.

Second Gentleman

That a king's children should be so convey'd,So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,That could not trace them!

First Gentleman

Howsoe'er 'tis strange,Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,Yet is it true, sir.

Second Gentleman

I do well believe you.

First Gentleman

We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,The queen, and princess.Exeunt
Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN


QUEEN

No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,After the slander of most stepmothers,Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, butYour gaoler shall deliver you the keysThat lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,So soon as I can win the offended king,I will be known your advocate: marry, yetThe fire of rage is in him, and 'twere goodYou lean'd unto his sentence with what patienceYour wisdom may inform you.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Please your highness,I will from hence to-day.

QUEEN

You know the peril.I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pityingThe pangs of barr'd affections, though the kingHath charged you should not speak together.Exit


IMOGEN

ODissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrantCan tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--Always reserved my holy duty--whatHis rage can do on me: you must be gone;And I shall here abide the hourly shotOf angry eyes, not comforted to live,But that there is this jewel in the worldThat I may see again.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

My queen! my mistress!O lady, weep no more, lest I give causeTo be suspected of more tendernessThan doth become a man. I will remainThe loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:My residence in Rome at one Philario's,Who to my father was a friend, to meKnown but by letter: thither write, my queen,And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,Though ink be made of gall.Re-enter QUEEN


QUEEN

Be brief, I pray you:If the king come, I shall incur I know notHow much of his displeasure.Aside
Yet I'll move himTo walk this way: I never do him wrong,But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;Pays dear for my offences.Exit


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Should we be taking leaveAs long a term as yet we have to live,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

IMOGEN

Nay, stay a little:Were you but riding forth to air yourself,Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;But keep it till you woo another wife,When Imogen is dead.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

How, how! another?You gentle gods, give me but this I have,And sear up my embracements from a nextWith bonds of death!Putting on the ring
Remain, remain thou hereWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,As I my poor self did exchange for you,To your so infinite loss, so in our triflesI still win of you: for my sake wear this;It is a manacle of love; I'll place itUpon this fairest prisoner.Putting a bracelet upon her arm


IMOGEN

O the gods!When shall we see again?Enter CYMBELINE and Lords


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Alack, the king!

CYMBELINE

Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!If after this command thou fraught the courtWith thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!Thou'rt poison to my blood.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

The gods protect you!And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.Exit


IMOGEN

                  There cannot be a pinch in deathMore sharp than this is.

CYMBELINE

O disloyal thing,That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'stA year's age on me.

IMOGEN

I beseech you, sir,Harm not yourself with your vexationI am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rareSubdues all pangs, all fears.

CYMBELINE

Past grace? obedience?

IMOGEN

Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

CYMBELINE

That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

IMOGEN

O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,And did avoid a puttock.

CYMBELINE

Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throneA seat for baseness.

IMOGEN

No; I rather addedA lustre to it.

CYMBELINE

                  O thou vile one!

IMOGEN

Sir,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:You bred him as my playfellow, and he isA man worth any woman, overbuys meAlmost the sum he pays.

CYMBELINE

What, art thou mad?

IMOGEN

Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I wereA neat-herd's daughter, and my LeonatusOur neighbour shepherd's son!

CYMBELINE

Thou foolish thing!Re-enter QUEEN
They were again together: you have doneNot after our command. Away with her,And pen her up.

QUEEN

                  Beseech your patience. Peace,Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfortOut of your best advice.

CYMBELINE

Nay, let her languishA drop of blood a day; and, being aged,Die of this folly!Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords


QUEEN

                  Fie! you must give way.Enter PISANIO
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

PISANIO

My lord your son drew on my master.

QUEEN

Ha!No harm, I trust, is done?

PISANIO

There might have been,But that my master rather play'd than foughtAnd had no help of anger: they were partedBy gentlemen at hand.

QUEEN

I am very glad on't.

IMOGEN

Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!I would they were in Afric both together;Myself by with a needle, that I might prickThe goer-back. Why came you from your master?

PISANIO

On his command: he would not suffer meTo bring him to the haven; left these notesOf what commands I should be subject to,When 't pleased you to employ me.

QUEEN

This hath beenYour faithful servant: I dare lay mine honourHe will remain so.

PISANIO

                  I humbly thank your highness.

QUEEN

Pray, walk awhile.

IMOGEN

                  About some half-hour hence,I pray you, speak with me: you shall at leastGo see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A public place.

Enter CLOTEN and two Lords


First Lord

Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; theviolence of action hath made you reek as asacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

CLOTEN

If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

Second Lord

[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.

First Lord

Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he benot hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

Second Lord

[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' thebackside the town.

CLOTEN

The villain would not stand me.

Second Lord

[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

First Lord

Stand you! You have land enough of your own: buthe added to your having; gave you some ground.

Second Lord

[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!

CLOTEN

I would they had not come between us.

Second Lord

[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how longa fool you were upon the ground.

CLOTEN

And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

Second Lord

[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, sheis damned.

First Lord

Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her braingo not together: she's a good sign, but I have seensmall reflection of her wit.

Second Lord

[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest thereflection should hurt her.

CLOTEN

Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been somehurt done!

Second Lord

[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fallof an ass, which is no great hurt.

CLOTEN

You'll go with us?

First Lord

I'll attend your lordship.

CLOTEN

Nay, come, let's go together.

Second Lord

Well, my lord.Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO


IMOGEN

I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,And question'dst every sail: if he should writeAnd not have it, 'twere a paper lost,As offer'd mercy is. What was the lastThat he spake to thee?

PISANIO

It was his queen, his queen!

IMOGEN

Then waved his handkerchief?

PISANIO

And kiss'd it, madam.

IMOGEN

Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!And that was all?

PISANIO

                  No, madam; for so longAs he could make me with this eye or earDistinguish him from others, he did keepThe deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mindCould best express how slow his soul sail'd on,How swift his ship.

IMOGEN

Thou shouldst have made himAs little as a crow, or less, ere leftTo after-eye him.

PISANIO

                  Madam, so I did.

IMOGEN

I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, butTo look upon him, till the diminutionOf space had pointed him sharp as my needle,Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted fromThe smallness of a gnat to air, and thenHave turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,When shall we hear from him?

PISANIO

Be assured, madam,With his next vantage.

IMOGEN

I did not take my leave of him, but hadMost pretty things to say: ere I could tell himHow I would think on him at certain hoursSuch thoughts and such, or I could make him swearThe shes of Italy should not betrayMine interest and his honour, or have charged him,At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,To encounter me with orisons, for thenI am in heaven for him; or ere I couldGive him that parting kiss which I had setBetwixt two charming words, comes in my fatherAnd like the tyrannous breathing of the northShakes all our buds from growing.Enter a Lady


Lady

The queen, madam,Desires your highness' company.

IMOGEN

Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.I will attend the queen.

PISANIO

Madam, I shall.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard


IACHIMO

Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he wasthen of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthyas since he hath been allowed the name of; but Icould then have looked on him without the help ofadmiration, though the catalogue of his endowmentshad been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.

PHILARIO

You speak of him when he was less furnished than nowhe is with that which makes him both without and within.

Frenchman

I have seen him in France: we had very many therecould behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

IACHIMO

This matter of marrying his king's daughter, whereinhe must be weighed rather by her value than his own,words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

Frenchman

And then his banishment.

IACHIMO

Ay, and the approbation of those that weep thislamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfullyto extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,which else an easy battery might lay flat, fortaking a beggar without less quality. But how comesit he is to sojourn with you? How creepsacquaintance?

PHILARIO

His father and I were soldiers together; to whom Ihave been often bound for no less than my life.Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertainedamongst you as suits, with gentlemen of yourknowing, to a stranger of his quality.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
I beseech you all, be better known to thisgentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friendof mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appearhereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

Frenchman

Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

Frenchman

Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad Idid atone my countryman and you; it had been pityyou should have been put together with so mortal apurpose as then each bore, upon importance of soslight and trivial a nature.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;rather shunned to go even with what I heard than inmy every action to be guided by others' experiences:but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to sayit is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.

Frenchman

'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,and by such two that would by all likelihood haveconfounded one the other, or have fallen both.

IACHIMO

Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

Frenchman

Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.It was much like an argument that fell out lastnight, where each of us fell in praise of ourcountry mistresses; this gentleman at that timevouching--and upon warrant of bloodyaffirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptablethan any the rarest of our ladies in France.

IACHIMO

That lady is not now living, or this gentleman'sopinion by this worn out.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

She holds her virtue still and I my mind.

IACHIMO

You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Being so far provoked as I was in France, I wouldabate her nothing, though I profess myself heradorer, not her friend.

IACHIMO

As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-handcomparison--had been something too fair and too goodfor any lady in Britain. If she went before othersI have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustresmany I have beheld. I could not but believe sheexcelled many: but I have not seen the mostprecious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.

IACHIMO

What do you esteem it at?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

More than the world enjoys.

IACHIMO

Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she'soutprized by a trifle.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, ifthere were wealth enough for the purchase, or meritfor the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,and only the gift of the gods.

IACHIMO

Which the gods have given you?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Which, by their graces, I will keep.

IACHIMO

You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Yourring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizableestimations; the one is but frail and the othercasual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplishedcourtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtierto convince the honour of my mistress, if, in theholding or loss of that, you term her frail. I donothing doubt you have store of thieves;notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

PHILARIO

Let us leave here, gentlemen.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, Ithank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.

IACHIMO

With five times so much conversation, I should getground of your fair mistress, make her go back, evento the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

No, no.

IACHIMO

I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate toyour ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues itsomething: but I make my wager rather against yourconfidence than her reputation: and, to bar youroffence herein too, I durst attempt it against anylady in the world.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

You are a great deal abused in too bold apersuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you'reworthy of by your attempt.

IACHIMO

What's that?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,deserve more; a punishment too.

PHILARIO

Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, bebetter acquainted.

IACHIMO

Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on theapprobation of what I have spoke!

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

What lady would you choose to assail?

IACHIMO

Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,that, commend me to the court where your lady is,with no more advantage than the opportunity of asecond conference, and I will bring from thencethat honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ringI hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

IACHIMO

You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buyladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannotpreserve it from tainting: but I see you have somereligion in you, that you fear.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear agraver purpose, I hope.

IACHIMO

I am the master of my speeches, and would undergowhat's spoken, I swear.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till yourreturn: let there be covenants drawn between's: mymistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of yourunworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

PHILARIO

I will have it no lay.

IACHIMO

By the gods, it is one. If I bring you nosufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearestbodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducatsare yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold areyours: provided I have your commendation for my morefree entertainment.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I embrace these conditions; let us have articlesbetwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: ifyou make your voyage upon her and give me directlyto understand you have prevailed, I am no furtheryour enemy; she is not worth our debate: if sheremain unseduced, you not making it appearotherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault youhave made to her chastity you shall answer me withyour sword.

IACHIMO

Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things setdown by lawful counsel, and straight away forBritain, lest the bargain should catch cold andstarve: I will fetch my gold and have our twowagers recorded.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Agreed.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO


Frenchman

Will this hold, think you?

PHILARIO

Signior Iachimo will not from it.Pray, let us follow 'em.Exeunt

SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS


QUEEN

Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;Make haste: who has the note of them?

First Lady

I, madam.

QUEEN

Dispatch.Exeunt Ladies
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

CORNELIUS

Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:Presenting a small box
But I beseech your grace, without offence,--My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you haveCommanded of me those most poisonous compounds,Which are the movers of a languishing death;But though slow, deadly?

QUEEN

I wonder, doctor,Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not beenThy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me howTo make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, soThat our great king himself doth woo me oftFor my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meetThat I did amplify my judgment inOther conclusions? I will try the forcesOf these thy compounds on such creatures asWe count not worth the hanging, but none human,To try the vigour of them and applyAllayments to their act, and by them gatherTheir several virtues and effects.

CORNELIUS

Your highnessShall from this practise but make hard your heart:Besides, the seeing these effects will beBoth noisome and infectious.

QUEEN

O, content thee.Enter PISANIO
Aside
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon himWill I first work: he's for his master,An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!Doctor, your service for this time is ended;Take your own way.

CORNELIUS

[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;But you shall do no harm.

QUEEN

[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.

CORNELIUS

[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she hasStrange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,And will not trust one of her malice withA drug of such damn'd nature. Those she hasWill stupefy and dull the sense awhile;Which first, perchance, she'll prove oncats and dogs,Then afterward up higher: but there isNo danger in what show of death it makes,More than the locking-up the spirits a time,To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'dWith a most false effect; and I the truer,So to be false with her.

QUEEN

No further service, doctor,Until I send for thee.

CORNELIUS

I humbly take my leave.Exit


QUEEN

Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in timeShe will not quench and let instructions enterWhere folly now possesses? Do thou work:When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,I'll tell thee on the instant thou art thenAs great as is thy master, greater, forHis fortunes all lie speechless and his nameIs at last gasp: return he cannot, norContinue where he is: to shift his beingIs to exchange one misery with another,And every day that comes comes to decayA day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,To be depender on a thing that leans,Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,So much as but to prop him?The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
Thou takest upThou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:It is a thing I made, which hath the kingFive times redeem'd from death: I do not knowWhat is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;It is an earnest of a further goodThat I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress howThe case stands with her; do't as from thyself.Think what a chance thou changest on, but thinkThou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the kingTo any shape of thy preferment suchAs thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,That set thee on to this desert, am boundTo load thy merit richly. Call my women:Think on my words.Exit PISANIO
A sly and constant knave,Not to be shaked; the agent for his masterAnd the remembrancer of her to holdThe hand-fast to her lord. I have given him thatWhich, if he take, shall quite unpeople herOf liegers for her sweet, and which she after,Except she bend her humour, shall be assuredTo taste of too.Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies
So, so: well done, well done:The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;Think on my words.Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies


PISANIO

And shall do:But when to my good lord I prove untrue,I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.Exit

SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.

Enter IMOGEN


IMOGEN

A father cruel, and a step-dame false;A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!My supreme crown of grief! and those repeatedVexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,As my two brothers, happy! but most miserableIs the desire that's glorious: blest be those,How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO


PISANIO

Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,Comes from my lord with letters.

IACHIMO

Change you, madam?The worthy Leonatus is in safetyAnd greets your highness dearly.Presents a letter


IMOGEN

Thanks, good sir:You're kindly welcome.

IACHIMO

[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,She is alone the Arabian bird, and IHave lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;Rather directly fly.

IMOGEN

[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whosekindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect uponhim accordingly, as you value your trust--LEONATUS.'So far I read aloud:But even the very middle of my heartIs warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.You are as welcome, worthy sir, as IHave words to bid you, and shall find it soIn all that I can do.

IACHIMO

Thanks, fairest lady.What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyesTo see this vaulted arch, and the rich cropOf sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixtThe fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stonesUpon the number'd beach? and can we notPartition make with spectacles so precious'Twixt fair and foul?

IMOGEN

What makes your admiration?

IACHIMO

It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way andContemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,For idiots in this case of favour wouldBe wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;Sluttery to such neat excellence opposedShould make desire vomit emptiness,Not so allured to feed.

IMOGEN

What is the matter, trow?

IACHIMO

The cloyed will,That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tubBoth fill'd and running, ravening first the lambLongs after for the garbage.

IMOGEN

What, dear sir,Thus raps you? Are you well?

IACHIMO

Thanks, madam; well.To PISANIO
Beseech you, sir, desireMy man's abode where I did leave him: heIs strange and peevish.

PISANIO

I was going, sir,To give him welcome.Exit


IMOGEN

Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

IACHIMO

Well, madam.

IMOGEN

Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

IACHIMO

Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger thereSo merry and so gamesome: he is call'dThe Briton reveller.

IMOGEN

When he was here,He did incline to sadness, and oft-timesNot knowing why.

IACHIMO

                  I never saw him sad.There is a Frenchman his companion, oneAn eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much lovesA Gallian girl at home; he furnacesThe thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knowsBy history, report, or his own proof,What woman is, yea, what she cannot chooseBut must be, will his free hours languish forAssured bondage?'

IMOGEN

                  Will my lord say so?

IACHIMO

Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:It is a recreation to be byAnd hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,Some men are much to blame.

IMOGEN

Not he, I hope.

IACHIMO

Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him mightBe used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;In you, which I account his beyond all talents,Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am boundTo pity too.

IMOGEN

                  What do you pity, sir?

IACHIMO

Two creatures heartily.

IMOGEN

Am I one, sir?You look on me: what wreck discern you in meDeserves your pity?

IACHIMO

Lamentable! What,To hide me from the radiant sun and solaceI' the dungeon by a snuff?

IMOGEN

I pray you, sir,Deliver with more openness your answersTo my demands. Why do you pity me?

IACHIMO

That others do--I was about to say--enjoy your--ButIt is an office of the gods to venge it,Not mine to speak on 't.

IMOGEN

You do seem to knowSomething of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--Since doubling things go ill often hurts moreThan to be sure they do; for certaintiesEither are past remedies, or, timely knowing,The remedy then born--discover to meWhat both you spur and stop.

IACHIMO

Had I this cheekTo bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soulTo the oath of loyalty; this object, whichTakes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,Slaver with lips as common as the stairsThat mount the Capitol; join gripes with handsMade hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, asWith labour; then by-peeping in an eyeBase and unlustrous as the smoky lightThat's fed with stinking tallow; it were fitThat all the plagues of hell should at one timeEncounter such revolt.

IMOGEN

My lord, I fear,Has forgot Britain.

IACHIMO

And himself. Not I,Inclined to this intelligence, pronounceThe beggary of his change; but 'tis your gracesThat from pay mutest conscience to my tongueCharms this report out.

IMOGEN

Let me hear no more.

IACHIMO

O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heartWith pity, that doth make me sick. A ladySo fair, and fasten'd to an empery,Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'dWith tomboys hired with that self-exhibitionWhich your own coffers yield! with diseased venturesThat play with all infirmities for goldWhich rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuffAs well might poison poison! Be revenged;Or she that bore you was no queen, and youRecoil from your great stock.

IMOGEN

Revenged!How should I be revenged? If this be true,--As I have such a heart that both mine earsMust not in haste abuse--if it be true,How should I be revenged?

IACHIMO

Should he make meLive, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,More noble than that runagate to your bed,And will continue fast to your affection,Still close as sure.

IMOGEN

What, ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO

Let me my service tender on your lips.

IMOGEN

Away! I do condemn mine ears that haveSo long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, notFor such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as farFrom thy report as thou from honour, andSolicit'st here a lady that disdainsThee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!The king my father shall be made acquaintedOf thy assault: if he shall think it fit,A saucy stranger in his court to martAs in a Romish stew and to expoundHis beastly mind to us, he hath a courtHe little cares for and a daughter whoHe not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO

O happy Leonatus! I may sayThe credit that thy lady hath of theeDeserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodnessHer assured credit. Blessed live you long!A lady to the worthiest sir that everCountry call'd his! and you his mistress, onlyFor the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.I have spoke this, to know if your affianceWere deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,That which he is, new o'er: and he is oneThe truest manner'd; such a holy witchThat he enchants societies into him;Half all men's hearts are his.

IMOGEN

You make amends.

IACHIMO

He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:He hath a kind of honour sets him off,More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,Most mighty princess, that I have adventuredTo try your taking a false report; which hathHonour'd with confirmation your great judgmentIn the election of a sir so rare,Which you know cannot err: the love I bear himMade me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

IMOGEN

All's well, sir: take my power i' the courtfor yours.

IACHIMO

My humble thanks. I had almost forgotTo entreat your grace but in a small request,And yet of moment to, for it concernsYour lord; myself and other noble friends,Are partners in the business.

IMOGEN

Pray, what is't?

IACHIMO

Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--The best feather of our wing--have mingled sumsTo buy a present for the emperorWhich I, the factor for the rest, have doneIn France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewelsOf rich and exquisite form; their values great;And I am something curious, being strange,To have them in safe stowage: may it please youTo take them in protection?

IMOGEN

Willingly;And pawn mine honour for their safety: sinceMy lord hath interest in them, I will keep themIn my bedchamber.

IACHIMO

They are in a trunk,Attended by my men: I will make boldTo send them to you, only for this night;I must aboard to-morrow.

IMOGEN

O, no, no.

IACHIMO

Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my wordBy lengthening my return. From GalliaI cross'd the seas on purpose and on promiseTo see your grace.

IMOGEN

I thank you for your pains:But not away to-morrow!

IACHIMO

O, I must, madam:Therefore I shall beseech you, if you pleaseTo greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:I have outstood my time; which is materialTo the tender of our present.

IMOGEN

I will write.Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.Exeunt

SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.

Enter CLOTEN and two Lords


CLOTEN

Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed thejack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had ahundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapesmust take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mineoaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.

First Lord

What got he by that? You have broke his pate withyour bowl.

Second Lord

[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,it would have run all out.

CLOTEN

When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not forany standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

Second Lord

No my lord;Aside
nor crop the ears of them.

CLOTEN

Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?Would he had been one of my rank!

Second Lord

[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.

CLOTEN

I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: apox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;they dare not fight with me, because of the queen mymother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful offighting, and I must go up and down like a cock thatnobody can match.

Second Lord

[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,cock, with your comb on.

CLOTEN

Sayest thou?

Second Lord

It is not fit your lordship should undertake everycompanion that you give offence to.

CLOTEN

No, I know that: but it is fit I should commitoffence to my inferiors.

Second Lord

Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

CLOTEN

Why, so I say.

First Lord

Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

CLOTEN

A stranger, and I not know on't!

Second Lord

[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows itnot.

First Lord

There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one ofLeonatus' friends.

CLOTEN

Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

First Lord

One of your lordship's pages.

CLOTEN

Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there noderogation in't?

Second Lord

You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN

Not easily, I think.

Second Lord

[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore yourissues, being foolish, do not derogate.

CLOTEN

Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lostto-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.

Second Lord

I'll attend your lordship.Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
That such a crafty devil as is his motherShould yield the world this ass! a woman thatBears all down with her brain; and this her sonCannot take two from twenty, for his heart,And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,A mother hourly coining plots, a wooerMore hateful than the foul expulsion isOf thy dear husband, than that horrid actOf the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firmThe walls of thy dear honour, keep unshakedThat temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!Exit

SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:

a trunk in one corner of it.IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending


IMOGEN

Who's there? my woman Helen?

Lady

Please you, madam

IMOGEN

What hour is it?

Lady

                  Almost midnight, madam.

IMOGEN

I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:Take not away the taper, leave it burning;And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me whollyExit Lady
To your protection I commend me, gods.From fairies and the tempters of the nightGuard me, beseech ye.Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk


IACHIMO

The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd senseRepairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thusDid softly press the rushes, ere he waken'dThe chastity he wounded. Cytherea,How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing thatPerfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taperBows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,To see the enclosed lights, now canopiedUnder these windows, white and azure lacedWith blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,To note the chamber: I will write all down:Such and such pictures; there the window; suchThe adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.Ah, but some natural notes about her body,Above ten thousand meaner moveablesWould testify, to enrich mine inventory.O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!And be her sense but as a monument,Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:Taking off her bracelet
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,As strongly as the conscience does within,To the madding of her lord. On her left breastA mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson dropsI' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,Stronger than ever law could make: this secretWill force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'enThe treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?Why should I write this down, that's riveted,Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading lateThe tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd downWhere Philomel gave up. I have enough:To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawningMay bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.Clock strikes
One, two, three: time, time!Goes into the trunk. The scene closes


Scene III

An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.Enter CLOTEN and Lords


First Lord

Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, themost coldest that ever turned up ace.

CLOTEN

It would make any man cold to lose.

First Lord

But not every man patient after the noble temper ofyour lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.

CLOTEN

Winning will put any man into courage. If I couldget this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.It's almost morning, is't not?

First Lord

Day, my lord.

CLOTEN

I would this music would come: I am advised to giveher music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.Enter Musicians
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with yourfingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if nonewill do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable richwords to it: and then let her consider.SONG
Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,And Phoebus 'gins arise,His steeds to water at those springsOn chaliced flowers that lies;And winking Mary-buds beginTo ope their golden eyes:With every thing that pretty is,My lady sweet, arise:Arise, arise.

CLOTEN

So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I willconsider your music the better: if it do not, it isa vice in her ears, which horse-hairs andcalves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch toboot, can never amend.Exeunt Musicians


Second Lord

Here comes the king.

CLOTEN

I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason Iwas up so early: he cannot choose but take thisservice I have done fatherly.Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.

CYMBELINE

Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?Will she not forth?

CLOTEN

I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.

CYMBELINE

The exile of her minion is too new;She hath not yet forgot him: some more timeMust wear the print of his remembrance out,And then she's yours.

QUEEN

You are most bound to the king,Who lets go by no vantages that mayPrefer you to his daughter. Frame yourselfTo orderly soliciting, and be friendedWith aptness of the season; make denialsIncrease your services; so seem as ifYou were inspired to do those duties whichYou tender to her; that you in all obey her,Save when command to your dismission tends,And therein you are senseless.

CLOTEN

Senseless! not so.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;The one is Caius Lucius.

CYMBELINE

A worthy fellow,Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;But that's no fault of his: we must receive himAccording to the honour of his sender;And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,We must extend our notice. Our dear son,When you have given good morning to your mistress,Attend the queen and us; we shall have needTo employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.Exeunt all but CLOTEN


CLOTEN

If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,Let her lie still and dream.Knocks
By your leave, ho!I Know her women are about her: whatIf I do line one of their hands? 'Tis goldWhich buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makesDiana's rangers false themselves, yield upTheir deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis goldWhich makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: whatCan it not do and undo? I will makeOne of her women lawyer to me, forI yet not understand the case myself.Knocks
By your leave.Enter a Lady


Lady

Who's there that knocks?

CLOTEN

A gentleman.

Lady

No more?

CLOTEN

Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.

Lady

That's moreThan some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?

CLOTEN

Your lady's person: is she ready?

Lady

Ay,To keep her chamber.

CLOTEN

There is gold for you;Sell me your good report.

Lady

How! my good name? or to report of youWhat I shall think is good?--The princess!Enter IMOGEN


CLOTEN

Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.Exit Lady


IMOGEN

Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much painsFor purchasing but trouble; the thanks I giveIs telling you that I am poor of thanksAnd scarce can spare them.

CLOTEN

Still, I swear I love you.

IMOGEN

If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:If you swear still, your recompense is stillThat I regard it not.

CLOTEN

This is no answer.

IMOGEN

But that you shall not say I yield being silent,I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,I shall unfold equal discourtesyTo your best kindness: one of your great knowingShould learn, being taught, forbearance.

CLOTEN

To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:I will not.

IMOGEN

          Fools are not mad folks.

CLOTEN

Do you call me fool?

IMOGEN

As I am mad, I do:If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,You put me to forget a lady's manners,By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,By the very truth of it, I care not for you,And am so near the lack of charity--To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had ratherYou felt than make't my boast.

CLOTEN

You sin againstObedience, which you owe your father. ForThe contract you pretend with that base wretch,One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,On whom there is no more dependencyBut brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement byThe consequence o' the crown, and must not soilThe precious note of it with a base slave.A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,A pantler, not so eminent.

IMOGEN

Profane fellowWert thou the son of Jupiter and no moreBut what thou art besides, thou wert too baseTo be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,Even to the point of envy, if 'twere madeComparative for your virtues, to be styledThe under-hangman of his kingdom, and hatedFor being preferred so well.

CLOTEN

The south-fog rot him!

IMOGEN

He never can meet more mischance than comeTo be but named of thee. His meanest garment,That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearerIn my respect than all the hairs above thee,Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!Enter PISANIO


CLOTEN

'His garment!' Now the devil--

IMOGEN

To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--

CLOTEN

'His garment!'

IMOGEN

                  I am sprited with a fool.Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my womanSearch for a jewel that too casuallyHath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,If I would lose it for a revenueOf any king's in Europe. I do thinkI saw't this morning: confident I amLast night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:I hope it be not gone to tell my lordThat I kiss aught but he.

PISANIO

'Twill not be lost.

IMOGEN

I hope so: go and search.Exit PISANIO


CLOTEN

You have abused me:'His meanest garment!'

IMOGEN

Ay, I said so, sir:If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

CLOTEN

I will inform your father.

IMOGEN

Your mother too:She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,To the worst of discontent.Exit


CLOTEN

I'll be revenged:'His meanest garment!' Well.Exit
CYMBELINE
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sureTo win the king as I am bold her honourWill remain hers.

PHILARIO

                  What means do you make to him?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Not any, but abide the change of time,Quake in the present winter's state and wishThat warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,I barely gratify your love; they failing,I must die much your debtor.

PHILARIO

Your very goodness and your companyO'erpays all I can do. By this, your kingHath heard of great Augustus: Caius LuciusWill do's commission throughly: and I thinkHe'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,Or look upon our Romans, whose remembranceIs yet fresh in their grief.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I do believe,Statist though I am none, nor like to be,That this will prove a war; and you shall hearThe legions now in Gallia sooner landedIn our not-fearing Britain than have tidingsOf any penny tribute paid. Our countrymenAre men more order'd than when Julius CaesarSmiled at their lack of skill, but foundtheir courageWorthy his frowning at: their discipline,Now mingled with their courages, will make knownTo their approvers they are people suchThat mend upon the world.Enter IACHIMO


PHILARIO

See! Iachimo!

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

The swiftest harts have posted you by land;And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,To make your vessel nimble.

PHILARIO

Welcome, sir.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I hope the briefness of your answer madeThe speediness of your return.

IACHIMO

Your ladyIs one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

And therewithal the best; or let her beautyLook through a casement to allure false heartsAnd be false with them.

IACHIMO

Here are letters for you.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Their tenor good, I trust.

IACHIMO

'Tis very like.

PHILARIO

Was Caius Lucius in the Britain courtWhen you were there?

IACHIMO

He was expected then,But not approach'd.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

All is well yet.Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't notToo dull for your good wearing?

IACHIMO

If I had lost it,I should have lost the worth of it in gold.I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoyA second night of such sweet shortness whichWas mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

The stone's too hard to come by.

IACHIMO

Not a whit,Your lady being so easy.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Make not, sir,Your loss your sport: I hope you know that weMust not continue friends.

IACHIMO

Good sir, we must,If you keep covenant. Had I not broughtThe knowledge of your mistress home, I grantWe were to question further: but I nowProfess myself the winner of her honour,Together with your ring; and not the wrongerOf her or you, having proceeded butBy both your wills.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

If you can make't apparentThat you have tasted her in bed, my handAnd ring is yours; if not, the foul opinionYou had of her pure honour gains or losesYour sword or mine, or masterless leaves bothTo who shall find them.

IACHIMO

Sir, my circumstances,Being so near the truth as I will make them,Must first induce you to believe: whose strengthI will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall findYou need it not.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

                  Proceed.

IACHIMO

First, her bedchamber,--Where, I confess, I slept not, but professHad that was well worth watching--it was hang'dWith tapesty of silk and silver; the storyProud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or forThe press of boats or pride: a piece of workSo bravely done, so rich, that it did striveIn workmanship and value; which I wonder'dCould be so rarely and exactly wrought,Since the true life on't was--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

This is true;And this you might have heard of here, by me,Or by some other.

IACHIMO

More particularsMust justify my knowledge.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

So they must,Or do your honour injury.

IACHIMO

The chimneyIs south the chamber, and the chimney-pieceChaste Dian bathing: never saw I figuresSo likely to report themselves: the cutterWas as another nature, dumb; outwent her,Motion and breath left out.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

This is a thingWhich you might from relation likewise reap,Being, as it is, much spoke of.

IACHIMO

The roof o' the chamberWith golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--I had forgot them--were two winking CupidsOf silver, each on one foot standing, nicelyDepending on their brands.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

This is her honour!Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praiseBe given to your remembrance--the descriptionOf what is in her chamber nothing savesThe wager you have laid.

IACHIMO

Then, if you can,Showing the bracelet
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!And now 'tis up again: it must be marriedTo that your diamond; I'll keep them.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Jove!Once more let me behold it: is it thatWhich I left with her?

IACHIMO

Sir--I thank her--that:She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;Her pretty action did outsell her gift,And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and saidShe prized it once.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

May be she pluck'd it offTo send it me.

IACHIMO

She writes so to you, doth she?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;Gives the ring
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honourWhere there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,Where there's another man: the vows of womenOf no more bondage be, to where they are made,Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.O, above measure false!

PHILARIO

Have patience, sir,And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:It may be probable she lost it; orWho knows if one of her women, being corrupted,Hath stol'n it from her?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Very true;And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:Render to me some corporal sign about her,More evident than this; for this was stolen.

IACHIMO

By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sureShe would not lose it: her attendants areAll sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:The cognizance of her incontinencyIs this: she hath bought the name of whorethus dearly.There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hellDivide themselves between you!

PHILARIO

Sir, be patient:This is not strong enough to be believedOf one persuaded well of--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Never talk on't;She hath been colted by him.

IACHIMO

If you seekFor further satisfying, under her breast--Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proudOf that most delicate lodging: by my life,I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hungerTo feed again, though full. You do rememberThis stain upon her?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Ay, and it doth confirmAnother stain, as big as hell can hold,Were there no more but it.

IACHIMO

Will you hear more?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;Once, and a million!

IACHIMO

I'll be sworn--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

No swearing.If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;And I will kill thee, if thou dost denyThou'st made me cuckold.

IACHIMO

I'll deny nothing.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!I will go there and do't, i' the court, beforeHer father. I'll do something--Exit


PHILARIO

Quite besidesThe government of patience! You have won:Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrathHe hath against himself.

IACHIMO

With an my heart.Exeunt

SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Is there no way for men to be but womenMust be half-workers? We are all bastards;And that most venerable man which IDid call my father, was I know not whereWhen I was stamp'd; some coiner with his toolsMade me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'dThe Dian of that time so doth my wifeThe nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'dAnd pray'd me oft forbearance; did it withA pudency so rosy the sweet view on'tMight well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought herAs chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no oppositionBut what he look'd for should oppose and sheShould from encounter guard. Could I find outThe woman's part in me! For there's no motionThat tends to vice in man, but I affirmIt is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,Nice longing, slanders, mutability,All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;For even to viceThey are not constant but are changing stillOne vice, but of a minute old, for oneNot half so old as that. I'll write against them,Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skillIn a true hate, to pray they have their will:The very devils cannot plague them better.Exit

SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.

Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,  and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants


CYMBELINE

Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

CAIUS LUCIUS

When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yetLives in men's eyes and will to ears and tonguesBe theme and hearing ever, was in this BritainAnd conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit lessThan in his feats deserving it--for himAnd his succession granted Rome a tribute,Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee latelyIs left untender'd.

QUEEN

And, to kill the marvel,Shall be so ever.

CLOTEN

There be many Caesars,Ere such another Julius. Britain isA world by itself; and we will nothing payFor wearing our own noses.

QUEEN

That opportunityWhich then they had to take from 's, to resumeWe have again. Remember, sir, my liege,The kings your ancestors, together withThe natural bravery of your isle, which standsAs Neptune's park, ribbed and paled inWith rocks unscalable and roaring waters,With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquestCaesar made here; but made not here his bragOf 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--That first that ever touch'd him--he was carriedFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'dAs easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereofThe famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires brightAnd Britons strut with courage.

CLOTEN

Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: ourkingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other ofthem may have crook'd noses, but to owe suchstraight arms, none.

CYMBELINE

Son, let your mother end.

CLOTEN

We have yet many among us can gripe as hard asCassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have ahand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? IfCaesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, orput the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tributefor light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

CYMBELINE

You must know,Till the injurious Romans did extortThis tribute from us, we were free:Caesar's ambition,Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretchThe sides o' the world, against all colour hereDid put the yoke upon 's; which to shake offBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckonOurselves to be.

CLOTEN

Lords

We do.

CYMBELINE

Say, then, to Caesar,Our ancestor was that Mulmutius whichOrdain'd our laws, whose use the sword of CaesarHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchiseShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,Who was the first of Britain which did putHis brows within a golden crown and call'dHimself a king.

CAIUS LUCIUS

                  I am sorry, Cymbeline,That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--Caesar, that hath more kings his servants thanThyself domestic officers--thine enemy:Receive it from me, then: war and confusionIn Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: lookFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,I thank thee for myself.

CYMBELINE

Thou art welcome, Caius.Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spentMuch under him; of him I gather'd honour;Which he to seek of me again, perforce,Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfectThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians forTheir liberties are now in arms; a precedentWhich not to read would show the Britons cold:So Caesar shall not find them.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Let proof speak.

CLOTEN

His majesty bids you welcome. Makepastime with us a day or two, or longer: ifyou seek us afterwards in other terms, youshall find us in our salt-water girdle: if youbeat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall inthe adventure, our crows shall fare the betterfor you; and there's an end.

CAIUS LUCIUS

So, sir.

CYMBELINE

I know your master's pleasure and he mine:All the remain is 'Welcome!'Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the palace.

Enter PISANIO, with a letter


PISANIO

How? of adultery? Wherefore write you notWhat monster's her accuser? Leonatus,O master! what a strange infectionIs fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'dOn thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaultsAs would take in some virtue. O my master!Thy mind to her is now as low as wereThy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?Upon the love and truth and vows which IHave made to thy command? I, her? her blood?If it be so to do good service, neverLet me be counted serviceable. How look I,That I should seem to lack humanityso much as this fact comes to?Reading
'Do't: the letterthat I have sent her, by her own commandShall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'stSo virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.I am ignorant in what I am commanded.Enter IMOGEN


IMOGEN

How now, Pisanio!

PISANIO

Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

IMOGEN

Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!O, learn'd indeed were that astronomerThat knew the stars as I his characters;He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,Let what is here contain'd relish of love,Of my lord's health, of his content, yet notThat we two are asunder; let that grieve him:Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,For it doth physic love: of his content,All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest beYou bees that make these locks of counsel! LoversAnd men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yetYou clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!Reads
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take mein his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, asyou, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew mewith your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out ofthis advise you, follow. So he wishes you allhappiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,increasing in love,LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell meHow far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairsMay plod it in a week, why may not IGlide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,To the smothering of the sense--how far it isTo this same blessed Milford: and by the wayTell me how Wales was made so happy asTo inherit such a haven: but first of all,How we may steal from hence, and for the gapThat we shall make in time, from our hence-goingAnd our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,How many score of miles may we well ride'Twixt hour and hour?

PISANIO

One score 'twixt sun and sun,Madam, 's enough for you:Aside
and too much too.

IMOGEN

Why, one that rode to's execution, man,Could never go so slow: I have heard ofriding wagers,Where horses have been nimbler than the sandsThat run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:Go bid my woman feign a sickness; sayShe'll home to her father: and provide me presentlyA riding-suit, no costlier than would fitA franklin's housewife.

PISANIO

Madam, you're best consider.

IMOGEN

I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,Accessible is none but Milford way.Exeunt

SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.

Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following


BELARIUS

A goodly day not to keep house, with suchWhose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gateInstructs you how to adore the heavens and bows youTo a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchsAre arch'd so high that giants may jet throughAnd keep their impious turbans on, withoutGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardlyAs prouder livers do.

GUIDERIUS

Hail, heaven!

ARVIRAGUS

Hail, heaven!

BELARIUS

Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,When you above perceive me like a crow,That it is place which lessens and sets off;And you may then revolve what tales I have told youOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:This service is not service, so being done,But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,Draws us a profit from all things we see;And often, to our comfort, shall we findThe sharded beetle in a safer holdThan is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this lifeIs nobler than attending for a cheque,Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.

GUIDERIUS

Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know notWhat air's from home. Haply this life is best,If quiet life be best; sweeter to youThat have a sharper known; well correspondingWith your stiff age: but unto us it isA cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;A prison for a debtor, that not daresTo stride a limit.

ARVIRAGUS

                  What should we speak ofWhen we are old as you? when we shall hearThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,In this our pinching cave, shall we discourseThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;Our valour is to chase what flies; our cageWe make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,And sing our bondage freely.

BELARIUS

How you speak!Did you but know the city's usuriesAnd felt them knowingly; the art o' the courtAs hard to leave as keep; whose top to climbIs certain falling, or so slippery thatThe fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,A pain that only seems to seek out dangerI' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'the search,And hath as oft a slanderous epitaphAs record of fair act; nay, many times,Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this storyThe world may read in me: my body's mark'dWith Roman swords, and my report was onceFirst with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,And when a soldier was the theme, my nameWas not far off: then was I as a treeWhose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,A storm or robbery, call it what you will,Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,And left me bare to weather.

GUIDERIUS

Uncertain favour!

BELARIUS

My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'dBefore my perfect honour, swore to CymbelineI was confederate with the Romans: soFollow'd my banishment, and this twenty yearsThis rock and these demesnes have been my world;Where I have lived at honest freedom, paidMore pious debts to heaven than in allThe fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!This is not hunters' language: he that strikesThe venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;To him the other two shall minister;And we will fear no poison, which attendsIn place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!These boys know little they are sons to the king;Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.They think they are mine; and though train'dup thus meanlyI' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hitThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts themIn simple and low things to prince it muchBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, whoThe king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!When on my three-foot stool I sit and tellThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly outInto my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even thenThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in postureThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,Strikes life into my speech and shows much moreHis own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knowsThou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,At three and two years old, I stole these babes;Thinking to bar thee of succession, asThou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,Thou wast their nurse; they took thee fortheir mother,And every day do honour to her grave:Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,They take for natural father. The game is up.Exit

SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.

Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN


IMOGEN

Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the placeWas near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother soTo see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sighFrom the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,Would be interpreted a thing perplex'dBeyond self-explication: put thyselfInto a havior of less fear, ere wildnessVanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?Why tender'st thou that paper to me, withA look untender? If't be summer news,Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'stBut keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongueMay take off some extremity, which to readWould be even mortal to me.

PISANIO

Please you, read;And you shall find me, wretched man, a thingThe most disdain'd of fortune.

IMOGEN

[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played thestrumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof liebleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,but from proof as strong as my grief and as certainas I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted withthe breach of hers. Let thine own hands take awayher life: I shall give thee opportunity atMilford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purposewhere, if thou fear to strike and to make me certainit is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour andequally to me disloyal.'

PISANIO

What shall I need to draw my sword? the paperHath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongueOutvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breathRides on the posting winds and doth belieAll corners of the world: kings, queens and states,Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the graveThis viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

IMOGEN

False to his bed! What is it to be false?To lie in watch there and to think on him?To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleepcharge nature,To break it with a fearful dream of himAnd cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

PISANIO

Alas, good lady!

IMOGEN

I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinksThy favour's good enough. Some jay of ItalyWhose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thoughtPut on for villany; not born where't grows,But worn a bait for ladies.

PISANIO

Good madam, hear me.

IMOGEN

True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weepingDid scandal many a holy tear, took pityFrom most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjuredFrom thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,A little witness my obedience: look!I draw the sword myself: take it, and hitThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart;Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;Thy master is not there, who was indeedThe riches of it: do his bidding; strikeThou mayst be valiant in a better cause;But now thou seem'st a coward.

PISANIO

Hence, vile instrument!Thou shalt not damn my hand.

IMOGEN

Why, I must die;And if I do not by thy hand, thou artNo servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughterThere is a prohibition so divineThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,Corrupters of my faith! you shall no moreBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor foolsBelieve false teachers: though those thatare betray'dDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitorStands in worse case of woe.And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set upMy disobedience 'gainst the king my fatherAnd make me put into contempt the suitsOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter findIt is no act of common passage, butA strain of rareness: and I grieve myselfTo think, when thou shalt be disedged by herThat now thou tirest on, how thy memoryWill then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,When I desire it too.

PISANIO

O gracious lady,Since I received command to do this businessI have not slept one wink.

IMOGEN

Do't, and to bed then.

PISANIO

I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

IMOGEN

Wherefore thenDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abusedSo many miles with a pretence? this place?Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,For my being absent? whereunto I neverPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,The elected deer before thee?

PISANIO

But to win timeTo lose so bad employment; in the whichI have consider'd of a course. Good lady,Hear me with patience.

IMOGEN

Talk thy tongue weary; speakI have heard I am a strumpet; and mine earTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

PISANIO

Then, madam,I thought you would not back again.

IMOGEN

Most like;Bringing me here to kill me.

PISANIO

Not so, neither:But if I were as wise as honest, thenMy purpose would prove well. It cannot beBut that my master is abused:Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.Hath done you both this cursed injury.

IMOGEN

Some Roman courtezan.

PISANIO

No, on my life.I'll give but notice you are dead and send himSome bloody sign of it; for 'tis commandedI should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,And that will well confirm it.

IMOGEN

Why good fellow,What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?Or in my life what comfort, when I amDead to my husband?

PISANIO

If you'll back to the court--

IMOGEN

No court, no father; nor no more adoWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to meAs fearful as a siege.

PISANIO

If not at court,Then not in Britain must you bide.

IMOGEN

Where thenHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volumeOur Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, thinkThere's livers out of Britain.

PISANIO

I am most gladYou think of other place. The ambassador,Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-HavenTo-morrow: now, if you could wear a mindDark as your fortune is, and but disguiseThat which, to appear itself, must not yet beBut by self-danger, you should tread a coursePretty and full of view; yea, haply, nearThe residence of Posthumus; so nigh at leastThat though his actions were not visible, yetReport should render him hourly to your earAs truly as he moves.

IMOGEN

O, for such means!Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,I would adventure.

PISANIO

Well, then, here's the point:You must forget to be a woman; changeCommand into obedience: fear and niceness--The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy andAs quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you mustForget that rarest treasure of your cheek,Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touchOf common-kissing Titan, and forgetYour laboursome and dainty trims, whereinYou made great Juno angry.

IMOGEN

Nay, be briefI see into thy end, and am almostA man already.

PISANIO

First, make yourself but like one.Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, allThat answer to them: would you in their serving,And with what imitation you can borrowFrom youth of such a season, 'fore noble LuciusPresent yourself, desire his service, tell himwherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,If that his head have ear in music,--doubtlessWith joy he will embrace you, for he's honourableAnd doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,You have me, rich; and I will never failBeginning nor supplyment.

IMOGEN

Thou art all the comfortThe gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:There's more to be consider'd; but we'll evenAll that good time will give us: this attemptI am soldier to, and will abide it withA prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

PISANIO

Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected ofYour carriage from the court. My noble mistress,Here is a box; I had it from the queen:What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of thisWill drive away distemper. To some shade,And fit you to your manhood. May the godsDirect you to the best!

IMOGEN

Amen: I thank thee.Exeunt, severally

SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants


CYMBELINE

Thus far; and so farewell.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Thanks, royal sir.My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;And am right sorry that I must report yeMy master's enemy.

CYMBELINE

                  Our subjects, sir,Will not endure his yoke; and for ourselfTo show less sovereignty than they, must needsAppear unkinglike.

CAIUS LUCIUS

                  So, sir: I desire of youA conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.Madam, all joy befal your grace!

QUEEN

And you!

CYMBELINE

My lords, you are appointed for that office;The due of honour in no point omit.So farewell, noble Lucius.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Your hand, my lord.

CLOTEN

Receive it friendly; but from this time forthI wear it as your enemy.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Sir, the eventIs yet to name the winner: fare you well.

CYMBELINE

Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords


QUEEN

He goes hence frowning: but it honours usThat we have given him cause.

CLOTEN

'Tis all the better;Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

CYMBELINE

Lucius hath wrote already to the emperorHow it goes here. It fits us therefore ripelyOur chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:The powers that he already hath in GalliaWill soon be drawn to head, from whence he movesHis war for Britain.

QUEEN

'Tis not sleepy business;But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

CYMBELINE

Our expectation that it would be thusHath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'dBefore the Roman, nor to us hath tender'dThe duty of the day: she looks us likeA thing more made of malice than of duty:We have noted it. Call her before us; forWe have been too slight in sufferance.Exit an Attendant


QUEEN

Royal sir,Since the exile of Posthumus, most retiredHath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a ladySo tender of rebukes that words are strokesAnd strokes death to her.Re-enter Attendant


CYMBELINE

Where is she, sir? HowCan her contempt be answer'd?

Attendant

Please you, sir,Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answerThat will be given to the loudest noise we make.

QUEEN

My lord, when last I went to visit her,She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,She should that duty leave unpaid to you,Which daily she was bound to proffer: thisShe wish'd me to make known; but our great courtMade me to blame in memory.

CYMBELINE

Her doors lock'd?Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fearProve false!Exit


QUEEN

Son, I say, follow the king.

CLOTEN

That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,have not seen these two days.

QUEEN

Go, look after.Exit CLOTEN
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absenceProceed by swallowing that, for he believesIt is a thing most precious. But for her,Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flownTo her desired Posthumus: gone she isTo death or to dishonour; and my endCan make good use of either: she being down,I have the placing of the British crown.Re-enter CLOTEN
How now, my son!

CLOTEN

'Tis certain she is fled.Go in and cheer the king: he rages; noneDare come about him.

QUEEN

[Aside]            All the better: mayThis night forestall him of the coming day!Exit


CLOTEN

I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisiteThan lady, ladies, woman; from every oneThe best she hath, and she, of all compounded,Outsells them all; I love her therefore: butDisdaining me and throwing favours onThe low Posthumus slanders so her judgmentThat what's else rare is choked; and in that pointI will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--Enter PISANIO
Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,Where is thy lady? In a word; or elseThou art straightway with the fiends.

PISANIO

O, good my lord!

CLOTEN

Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--I will not ask again. Close villain,I'll have this secret from thy heart, or ripThy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?From whose so many weights of baseness cannotA dram of worth be drawn.

PISANIO

Alas, my lord,How can she be with him? When was she missed?He is in Rome.

CLOTEN

                  Where is she, sir? Come nearer;No further halting: satisfy me homeWhat is become of her.

PISANIO

O, my all-worthy lord!

CLOTEN

All-worthy villain!Discover where thy mistress is at once,At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'Speak, or thy silence on the instant isThy condemnation and thy death.

PISANIO

Then, sir,This paper is the history of my knowledgeTouching her flight.Presenting a letter


CLOTEN

Let's see't. I will pursue herEven to Augustus' throne.

PISANIO

[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.She's far enough; and what he learns by thisMay prove his travel, not her danger.

CLOTEN

Hum!

PISANIO

[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

CLOTEN

Sirrah, is this letter true?

PISANIO

Sir, as I think.

CLOTEN

It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thouwouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,undergo those employments wherein I should havecause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform itdirectly and truly, I would think thee an honestman: thou shouldst neither want my means for thyrelief nor my voice for thy preferment.

PISANIO

Well, my good lord.

CLOTEN

Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently andconstantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune ofthat beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in thecourse of gratitude, but be a diligent follower ofmine: wilt thou serve me?

PISANIO

Sir, I will.

CLOTEN

Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thylate master's garments in thy possession?

PISANIO

I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit hewore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

CLOTEN

The first service thou dost me, fetch that suithither: let it be thy lint service; go.

PISANIO

I shall, my lord.Exit


CLOTEN

Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him onething; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thouvillain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would thesegarments were come. She said upon a time--thebitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that sheheld the very garment of Posthumus in more respectthan my noble and natural person together with theadornment of my qualities. With that suit upon myback, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in hereyes; there shall she see my valour, which will thenbe a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, myspeech of insultment ended on his dead body, andwhen my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vexher I will execute in the clothes that she sopraised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foother home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,and I'll be merry in my revenge.Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes
Be those the garments?

PISANIO

Ay, my noble lord.

CLOTEN

How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?

PISANIO

She can scarce be there yet.

CLOTEN

Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the secondthing that I have commanded thee: the third is,that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Bebut duteous, and true preferment shall tender itselfto thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I hadwings to follow it! Come, and be true.Exit


PISANIO

Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to theeWere to prove false, which I will never be,To him that is most true. To Milford go,And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speedBe cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!Exit

I see a man's life is a tedious one:I have tired myself, and for two nights togetherHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick,But that my resolution helps me. Milford,When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I thinkFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told meI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tisA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulnessIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehoodIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,My hunger's gone; but even before, I wasAt point to sink for food. But what is this?Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:I were best not to call; I dare not call:yet famine,Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness everOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.Best draw my sword: and if mine enemyBut fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.Such a foe, good heavens!Exit, to the cave
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS


BELARIUS

You, Polydote, have proved best woodman andAre master of the feast: Cadwal and IWill play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:The sweat of industry would dry and die,But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachsWill make what's homely savoury: wearinessCan snore upon the flint, when resty slothFinds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

GUIDERIUS

I am thoroughly weary.

ARVIRAGUS

I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

GUIDERIUS

There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

BELARIUS

[Looking into the cave]Stay; come not in.But that it eats our victuals, I should thinkHere were a fairy.

GUIDERIUS

What's the matter, sir?

BELARIUS

By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,An earthly paragon! Behold divinenessNo elder than a boy!Re-enter IMOGEN


IMOGEN

Good masters, harm me not:Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thoughtTo have begg'd or bought what I have took:good troth,I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had foundGold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:I would have left it on the board so soonAs I had made my meal, and partedWith prayers for the provider.

GUIDERIUS

Money, youth?

ARVIRAGUS

All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of thoseWho worship dirty gods.

IMOGEN

I see you're angry:Know, if you kill me for my fault, I shouldHave died had I not made it.

BELARIUS

Whither bound?

IMOGEN

To Milford-Haven.

BELARIUS

What's your name?

IMOGEN

Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman whoIs bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,I am fall'n in this offence.

BELARIUS

Prithee, fair youth,Think us no churls, nor measure our good mindsBy this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheerEre you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.Boys, bid him welcome.

GUIDERIUS

Were you a woman, youth,I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,I bid for you as I'd buy.

ARVIRAGUS

I'll make't my comfortHe is a man; I'll love him as my brother:And such a welcome as I'd give to himAfter long absence, such is yours: most welcome!Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.

IMOGEN

GUIDERIUS

ARVIRAGUS

Or I, whate'er it be,What pain it cost, what danger. God's!

BELARIUS

Hark, boys.Whispering


IMOGEN

Great men,That had a court no bigger than this cave,That did attend themselves and had the virtueWhich their own conscience seal'd them--laying byThat nothing-gift of differing multitudes--Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!I'd change my sex to be companion with them,Since Leonatus's false.

BELARIUS

It shall be so.Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,So far as thou wilt speak it.

GUIDERIUS

Pray, draw near.

ARVIRAGUS

The night to the owl and morn to the larkless welcome.

IMOGEN

Thanks, sir.

ARVIRAGUS

I pray, draw near.Exeunt

SCENE VII. Rome. A public place.

Enter two Senators and Tribunes


First Senator

This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:That since the common men are now in action'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,And that the legions now in Gallia areFull weak to undertake our wars againstThe fall'n-off Britons, that we do inciteThe gentry to this business. He createsLucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,For this immediate levy, he commendsHis absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

First Tribune

Is Lucius general of the forces?

Second Senator

Ay.

First Tribune

Remaining now in Gallia?

First Senator

With those legionsWhich I have spoke of, whereunto your levyMust be supplyant: the words of your commissionWill tie you to the numbers and the timeOf their dispatch.

First Tribune

                  We will discharge our duty.Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius.

Enter CLOTEN


CLOTEN

I am near to the place where they should meet, ifPisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garmentsserve me! Why should his mistress, who was made byhim that made the tailor, not be fit too? therather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis saida woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I mustplay the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for itis not vain-glory for a man and his glass to conferin his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body areas well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in theadvantage of the time, above him in birth, alikeconversant in general services, and more remarkablein single oppositions: yet this imperceiverantthing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thyshoulders, shall within this hour be off; thymistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces beforethy face: and all this done, spurn her home to herfather; who may haply be a little angry for my sorough usage; but my mother, having power of histestiness, shall turn all into my commendations. Myhorse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sorepurpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This isthe very description of their meeting-place; andthe fellow dares not deceive me.Exit

SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.

Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN


BELARIUS

[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;We'll come to you after hunting.

ARVIRAGUS

[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay hereAre we not brothers?

IMOGEN

So man and man should be;But clay and clay differs in dignity,Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

GUIDERIUS

Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

IMOGEN

So sick I am not, yet I am not well;But not so citizen a wanton asTo seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;Stick to your journal course: the breach of customIs breach of all. I am ill, but your being by meCannot amend me; society is no comfortTo one not sociable: I am not very sick,Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,Stealing so poorly.

GUIDERIUS

I love thee; I have spoke itHow much the quantity, the weight as much,As I do love my father.

BELARIUS

What! how! how!

ARVIRAGUS

If it be sin to say so, I yoke meIn my good brother's fault: I know not whyI love this youth; and I have heard you say,Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say'My father, not this youth.'

BELARIUS

[Aside]	O noble strain!O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.I'm not their father; yet who this should be,Doth miracle itself, loved before me.'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.

ARVIRAGUS

Brother, farewell.

IMOGEN

I wish ye sport.

ARVIRAGUS

                  You health. So please you, sir.

IMOGEN

[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what liesI have heard!Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:Experience, O, thou disprovest report!The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dishPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,I'll now taste of thy drug.Swallows some


GUIDERIUS

I could not stir him:He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

ARVIRAGUS

Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafterI might know more.

BELARIUS

To the field, to the field!We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.

ARVIRAGUS

We'll not be long away.

BELARIUS

Pray, be not sick,For you must be our housewife.

IMOGEN

Well or ill,I am bound to you.

BELARIUS

And shalt be ever.Exit IMOGEN, to the cave
This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath hadGood ancestors.

ARVIRAGUS

                  How angel-like he sings!

GUIDERIUS

But his neat cookery! he cut our rootsIn characters,And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sickAnd he her dieter.

ARVIRAGUS

Nobly he yokesA smiling with a sigh, as if the sighWas that it was, for not being such a smile;The smile mocking the sigh, that it would flyFrom so divine a temple, to commixWith winds that sailors rail at.

GUIDERIUS

I do noteThat grief and patience, rooted in him both,Mingle their spurs together.

ARVIRAGUS

Grow, patience!And let the stinking elder, grief, untwineHis perishing root with the increasing vine!

BELARIUS

It is great morning. Come, away!--Who's there?Enter CLOTEN


CLOTEN

I cannot find those runagates; that villainHath mock'd me. I am faint.

BELARIUS

'Those runagates!'Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tisCloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.I saw him not these many years, and yetI know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!

GUIDERIUS

He is but one: you and my brother searchWhat companies are near: pray you, away;Let me alone with him.Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS


CLOTEN

                  Soft! What are youThat fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

GUIDERIUS

A thingMore slavish did I ne'er than answeringA slave without a knock.

CLOTEN

Thou art a robber,A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.

GUIDERIUS

To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not IAn arm as big as thine? a heart as big?Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear notMy dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,Why I should yield to thee?

CLOTEN

Thou villain base,Know'st me not by my clothes?

GUIDERIUS

No, nor thy tailor, rascal,Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,Which, as it seems, make thee.

CLOTEN

Thou precious varlet,My tailor made them not.

GUIDERIUS

Hence, then, and thankThe man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;I am loath to beat thee.

CLOTEN

Thou injurious thief,Hear but my name, and tremble.

GUIDERIUS

What's thy name?

CLOTEN

Cloten, thou villain.

GUIDERIUS

Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, orAdder, Spider,'Twould move me sooner.

CLOTEN

To thy further fear,Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt knowI am son to the queen.

GUIDERIUS

I am sorry for 't; not seemingSo worthy as thy birth.

CLOTEN

Art not afeard?

GUIDERIUS

Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:At fools I laugh, not fear them.

CLOTEN

Die the death:When I have slain thee with my proper hand,I'll follow those that even now fled hence,And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:Yield, rustic mountaineer.Exeunt, fighting
Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS


BELARIUS

No companies abroad?

ARVIRAGUS

None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.

BELARIUS

I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favourWhich then he wore; the snatches in his voice,And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute'Twas very Cloten.

ARVIRAGUS

                  In this place we left them:I wish my brother make good time with him,You say he is so fell.

BELARIUS

Being scarce made up,I mean, to man, he had not apprehensionOf roaring terrors; for the effect of judgmentIs oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head


GUIDERIUS

This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;There was no money in't: not HerculesCould have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:Yet I not doing this, the fool had borneMy head as I do his.

BELARIUS

What hast thou done?

GUIDERIUS

I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,Son to the queen, after his own report;Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and sworeWith his own single hand he'ld take us inDisplace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,And set them on Lud's-town.

BELARIUS

We are all undone.

GUIDERIUS

Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,But that he swore to take, our lives? The lawProtects not us: then why should we be tenderTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,Play judge and executioner all himself,For we do fear the law? What companyDiscover you abroad?

BELARIUS

No single soulCan we set eye on; but in all safe reasonHe must have some attendants. Though his humourWas nothing but mutation, ay, and thatFrom one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, notAbsolute madness could so far have ravedTo bring him here alone; although perhapsIt may be heard at court that such as weCave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in timeMay make some stronger head; the which he hearing--As it is like him--might break out, and swearHe'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probableTo come alone, either he so undertaking,Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,If we do fear this body hath a tailMore perilous than the head.

ARVIRAGUS

Let ordinanceCome as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,My brother hath done well.

BELARIUS

I had no mindTo hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sicknessDid make my way long forth.

GUIDERIUS

With his own sword,Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'enHis head from him: I'll throw't into the creekBehind our rock; and let it to the sea,And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:That's all I reck.Exit


BELARIUS

I fear 'twill be revenged:Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valourBecomes thee well enough.

ARVIRAGUS

Would I had done'tSo the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,I love thee brotherly, but envy muchThou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,That possible strength might meet, would seek us throughAnd put us to our answer.

BELARIUS

Well, 'tis done:We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for dangerWhere there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stayTill hasty Polydote return, and bring himTo dinner presently.

ARVIRAGUS

Poor sick Fidele!I'll weringly to him: to gain his colourI'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,And praise myself for charity.Exit


BELARIUS

O thou goddess,Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'stIn these two princely boys! They are as gentleAs zephyrs blowing below the violet,Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,That by the top doth take the mountain pine,And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonderThat an invisible instinct should frame themTo royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,Civility not seen from other, valourThat wildly grows in them, but yields a cropAs if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strangeWhat Cloten's being here to us portends,Or what his death will bring us.Re-enter GUIDERIUS

GUIDERIUS

Is he at home?

BELARIUS

                  He went hence even now.

GUIDERIUS

What does he mean? since death of my dear'st motherit did not speak before. All solemn thingsShould answer solemn accidents. The matter?Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toysIs jollity for apes and grief for boys.Is Cadwal mad?

ARVIRAGUS

The bird is deadThat we have made so much on. I had ratherHave skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,Than have seen this.

GUIDERIUS

O sweetest, fairest lily!My brother wears thee not the one half so wellAs when thou grew'st thyself.

BELARIUS

O melancholy!Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? findThe ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crareMight easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.How found you him?

ARVIRAGUS

Stark, as you see:Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; hisright cheekReposing on a cushion.

GUIDERIUS

Where?

ARVIRAGUS

O' the floor;His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and putMy clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudenessAnswer'd my steps too loud.

GUIDERIUS

Why, he but sleeps:If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,And worms will not come to thee.

ARVIRAGUS

With fairest flowersWhilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lackThe flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, norThe azured harebell, like thy veins, no, norThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shamingThose rich-left heirs that let their fathers lieWithout a monument!--bring thee all this;Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,To winter-ground thy corse.

GUIDERIUS

Prithee, have done;And do not play in wench-like words with thatWhich is so serious. Let us bury him,And not protract with admiration whatIs now due debt. To the grave!

ARVIRAGUS

Say, where shall's lay him?

GUIDERIUS

By good Euriphile, our mother.

ARVIRAGUS

Be't so:And let us, Polydore, though now our voicesHave got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,As once our mother; use like note and words,Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

GUIDERIUS

Cadwal,I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;For notes of sorrow out of tune are worseThan priests and fanes that lie.

ARVIRAGUS

We'll speak it, then.

BELARIUS

Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for ClotenIs quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;And though he came our enemy, rememberHe was paid for that: though mean andmighty, rottingTogether, have one dust, yet reverence,That angel of the world, doth make distinctionOf place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princelyAnd though you took his life, as being our foe,Yet bury him as a prince.

GUIDERIUS

Pray You, fetch him hither.Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',When neither are alive.

ARVIRAGUS

If you'll go fetch him,We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.Exit BELARIUS


GUIDERIUS

Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;My father hath a reason for't.

ARVIRAGUS

'Tis true.

GUIDERIUS

Come on then, and remove him.

ARVIRAGUS

So. Begin.SONG


GUIDERIUS

     Fear no more the heat o' the sun,Nor the furious winter's rages;Thou thy worldly task hast done,Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:Golden lads and girls all must,As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

ARVIRAGUS

     Fear no more the frown o' the great;Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;Care no more to clothe and eat;To thee the reed is as the oak:The sceptre, learning, physic, mustAll follow this, and come to dust.

But what from Rome?

Captain

The senate hath stirr'd up the confinersAnd gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,That promise noble service: and they comeUnder the conduct of bold Iachimo,Syenna's brother.

CAIUS LUCIUS

                  When expect you them?

Captain

With the next benefit o' the wind.

CAIUS LUCIUS

This forwardnessMakes our hopes fair. Command our present numbersBe muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?

Soothsayer

Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'dFrom the spongy south to this part of the west,There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--Unless my sins abuse my divination--Success to the Roman host.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Dream often so,And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is hereWithout his top? The ruin speaks that sometimeIt was a worthy building. How! a page!Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;For nature doth abhor to make his bedWith the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.Let's see the boy's face.

Captain

He's alive, my lord.

He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seemsThey crave to be demanded. Who is thisThou makest thy bloody pillow?

                  I am nothing: or if not,Nothing to be were better. This was my master,A very valiant Briton and a good,That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!There is no more such masters: I may wanderFrom east to occident, cry out for service,Try many, all good, serve truly, neverFind such another master.

Thou dost approve thyself the very same:Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not sayThou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,Sent by a consul to me, should not soonerThan thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.

IMOGEN

I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,I'll hide my master from the flies, as deepAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and whenWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,And on it said a century of prayers,Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;And leaving so his service, follow you,So please you entertain me.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Ay, good youth!And rather father thee than master thee.My friends,The boy hath taught us manly duties: let usFind out the prettiest daisied plot we can,And make him with our pikes and partisansA grave: come, arm him.

But for thee, fellow,Who needs must know of her departure andDost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from theeBy a sharp torture.

Sir, my life is yours;I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,I nothing know where she remains, why gone,Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,Hold me your loyal servant.

We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousyDoes yet depend.

First Lord

                  So please your majesty,The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,Are landed on your coast, with a supplyOf Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.

CYMBELINE

Now for the counsel of my son and queen!I am amazed with matter.

First Lord

Good my liege,Your preparation can affront no lessThan what you hear of: come more, for moreyou're ready:The want is but to put those powers in motionThat long to move.

CYMBELINE

                  I thank you. Let's withdraw;And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear notWhat can from Italy annoy us; butWe grieve at chances here. Away!Exeunt all but PISANIO


PISANIO

I heard no letter from my master sinceI wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:Nor hear I from my mistress who did promiseTo yield me often tidings: neither know IWhat is betid to Cloten; but remainPerplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.These present wars shall find I love my country,Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.Exit

SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.

Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.


GUIDERIUS

The noise is round about us.

BELARIUS

Let us from it.

ARVIRAGUS

What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock itFrom action and adventure?

GUIDERIUS

Nay, what hopeHave we in hiding us? This way, the RomansMust or for Britons slay us, or receive usFor barbarous and unnatural revoltsDuring their use, and slay us after.

BELARIUS

Sons,We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.To the king's party there's no going: newnessOf Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'dAmong the bands--may drive us to a renderWhere we have lived, and so extort from's thatWhich we have done, whose answer would be deathDrawn on with torture.

GUIDERIUS

This is, sir, a doubtIn such a time nothing becoming you,Nor satisfying us.

ARVIRAGUS

                  It is not likelyThat when they hear the Roman horses neigh,Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyesAnd ears so cloy'd importantly as now,That they will waste their time upon our note,To know from whence we are.

BELARIUS

O, I am knownOf many in the army: many years,Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore himFrom my remembrance. And, besides, the kingHath not deserved my service nor your loves;Who find in my exile the want of breeding,The certainty of this hard life; aye hopelessTo have the courtesy your cradle promised,But to be still hot summer's tamings andThe shrinking slaves of winter.

GUIDERIUS

Than be soBetter to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:I and my brother are not known; yourselfSo out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,Cannot be question'd.

ARVIRAGUS

By this sun that shines,I'll thither: what thing is it that I neverDid see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!Never bestrid a horse, save one that hadA rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowelNor iron on his heel! I am ashamedTo look upon the holy sun, to haveThe benefit of his blest beams, remainingSo long a poor unknown.

GUIDERIUS

By heavens, I'll go:If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,I'll take the better care, but if you will not,The hazard therefore due fall on me byThe hands of Romans!

ARVIRAGUS

So say I	amen.

BELARIUS

No reason I, since of your lives you setSo slight a valuation, should reserveMy crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!If in your country wars you chance to die,That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:Lead, lead.Aside
The time seems long; their bloodthinks scorn,Till it fly out and show them princes born.Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.

Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'dThou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,If each of you should take this course, how manyMust murder wives much better than themselvesFor wrying but a little! O Pisanio!Every good servant does not all commands:No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if youShould have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I neverHad lived to put on this: so had you savedThe noble Imogen to repent, and struckMe, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,To have them fall no more: you some permitTo second ills with ills, each elder worse,And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,And make me blest to obey! I am brought hitherAmong the Italian gentry, and to fightAgainst my lady's kingdom: 'tis enoughThat, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe meOf these Italian weeds and suit myselfAs does a Briton peasant: so I'll fightAgainst the part I come with; so I'll dieFor thee, O Imogen, even for whom my lifeIs every breath a death; and thus, unknown,Pitied nor hated, to the face of perilMyself I'll dedicate. Let me make men knowMore valour in me than my habits show.Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!To shame the guise o' the world, I will beginThe fashion, less without and more within.Exit

SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.

Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him


IACHIMO

The heaviness and guilt within my bosomTakes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,The princess of this country, and the air on'tRevengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,A very drudge of nature's, have subdued meIn my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borneAs I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.If that thy gentry, Britain, go beforeThis lout as he exceeds our lords, the oddsIs that we scarce are men and you are gods.Exit
The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS


BELARIUS

Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;The lane is guarded: nothing routs us butThe villany of our fears.

GUIDERIUS

ARVIRAGUS

Stand, stand, and fight!Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN


CAIUS LUCIUS

Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;For friends kill friends, and the disorder's suchAs war were hoodwink'd.

IACHIMO

'Tis their fresh supplies.

CAIUS LUCIUS

It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimesLet's reinforce, or fly.Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the field.

Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord


Lord

Camest thou from where they made the stand?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I did.Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

Lord

I did.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,But that the heavens fought: the king himselfOf his wings destitute, the army broken,And but the backs of Britons seen, all flyingThrough a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having workMore plentiful than tools to do't, struck downSome mortally, some slightly touch'd, some fallingMerely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'dWith dead men hurt behind, and cowards livingTo die with lengthen'd shame.

Lord

Where was this lane?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,An honest one, I warrant; who deservedSo long a breeding as his white beard came to,In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,He, with two striplings-lads more like to runThe country base than to commit such slaughterWith faces fit for masks, or rather fairerThan those for preservation cased, or shame--Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;Or we are Romans and will give you thatLike beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'These three,Three thousand confident, in act as many--For three performers are the file when allThe rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'Accommodated by the place, more charmingWith their own nobleness, which could have turn'dA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,turn'd cowardBut by example--O, a sin in war,Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to lookThe way that they did, and to grin like lionsUpon the pikes o' the hunters. Then beganA stop i' the chaser, a retire, anonA rout, confusion thick; forthwith they flyChickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,Like fragments in hard voyages, becameThe life o' the need: having found the backdoor openOf the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!Some slain before; some dying; some their friendsO'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:Those that would die or ere resist are grownThe mortal bugs o' the field.

Lord

This was strange chanceA narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Nay, do not wonder at it: you are madeRather to wonder at the things you hearThan to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

Lord

Nay, be not angry, sir.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

'Lack, to what end?Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;For if he'll do as he is made to do,I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.You have put me into rhyme.

Lord

Farewell; you're angry.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Still going?Exit Lord
This is a lord! O noble misery,To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!To-day how many would have given their honoursTo have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,Could not find death where I did hear him groan,Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,Sweet words; or hath more ministers than weThat draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find himFor being now a favourer to the Briton,No more a Briton, I have resumed againThe part I came in: fight I will no more,But yield me to the veriest hind that shallOnce touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter isHere made by the Roman; great the answer beBritons must take. For me, my ransom's death;On either side I come to spend my breath;Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,But end it by some means for Imogen.Enter two British Captains and Soldiers


First Captain

Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.

Second Captain

There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,That gave the affront with them.

First Captain

So 'tis reported:But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

A Roman,Who had not now been drooping here, if secondsHad answer'd him.

Second Captain

                  Lay hands on him; a dog!A leg of Rome shall not return to tellWhat crows have peck'd them here. He bragshis serviceAs if he were of note: bring him to the king.Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes

SCENE IV. A British prison.

Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers


First Gaoler

You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;So graze as you find pasture.

Second Gaoler

Ay, or a stomach.Exeunt Gaolers


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,think, to liberty: yet am I betterThan one that's sick o' the gout; since he had ratherGroan so in perpetuity than be curedBy the sure physician, death, who is the keyTo unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'dMore than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give meThe penitent instrument to pick that bolt,Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?So children temporal fathers do appease;Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?I cannot do it better than in gyves,Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,If of my freedom 'tis the main part, takeNo stricter render of me than my all.I know you are more clement than vile men,Who of their broken debtors take a third,A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive againOn their abatement: that's not my desire:For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,If you will take this audit, take this life,And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!I'll speak to thee in silence.Sleeps
Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,  SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,  an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in  his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:  then, after other music, follow the two young  Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping


Sicilius Leonatus

No more, thou thunder-master, showThy spite on mortal flies:With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,That thy adulteriesRates and revenges.Hath my poor boy done aught but well,Whose face I never saw?I died whilst in the womb he stay'dAttending nature's law:Whose father then, as men reportThou orphans' father art,Thou shouldst have been, and shielded himFrom this earth-vexing smart.

Mother

Lucina lent not me her aid,But took me in my throes;That from me was Posthumus ript,Came crying 'mongst his foes,A thing of pity!

Sicilius Leonatus

Great nature, like his ancestry,Moulded the stuff so fair,That he deserved the praise o' the world,As great Sicilius' heir.

First Brother

When once he was mature for man,In Britain where was heThat could stand up his parallel;Or fruitful object beIn eye of Imogen, that bestCould deem his dignity?

Mother

With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,To be exiled, and thrownFrom Leonati seat, and castFrom her his dearest one,Sweet Imogen?

Sicilius Leonatus

Why did you suffer Iachimo,Slight thing of Italy,To taint his nobler heart and brainWith needless jealosy;And to become the geck and scornO' th' other's villany?

Second Brother

For this from stiller seats we came,Our parents and us twain,That striking in our country's causeFell bravely and were slain,Our fealty and Tenantius' rightWith honour to maintain.

First Brother

Like hardiment Posthumus hathTo Cymbeline perform'd:Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,Why hast thou thus adjourn'dThe graces for his merits due,Being all to dolours turn'd?

Sicilius Leonatus

Thy crystal window ope; look out;No longer exerciseUpon a valiant race thy harshAnd potent injuries.

Mother

Since, Jupiter, our son is good,Take off his miseries.

Sicilius Leonatus

Peep through thy marble mansion; help;Or we poor ghosts will cryTo the shining synod of the restAgainst thy deity.

First Brother

Second Brother

Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,And from thy justice fly.Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting  upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their knees


Jupiter

No more, you petty spirits of region low,Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghostsAccuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and restUpon your never-withering banks of flowers:Be not with mortal accidents opprest;No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and inOur temple was he married. Rise, and fade.He shall be lord of lady Imogen,And happier much by his affliction made.This tablet lay upon his breast, whereinOur pleasure his full fortune doth confine:and so, away: no further with your dinExpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.Ascends


Sicilius Leonatus

He came in thunder; his celestial breathWas sulphurous to smell: the holy eagleStoop'd as to foot us: his ascension isMore sweet than our blest fields: his royal birdPrunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,As when his god is pleased.

All

Thanks, Jupiter!

Sicilius Leonatus

The marble pavement closes, he is enter'dHis radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,Let us with care perform his great behest.The Apparitions vanish


Posthumus Leonatus

[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begotA father to me; and thou hast createdA mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:And so I am awake. Poor wretches that dependOn greatness' favour dream as I have done,Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:Many dream not to find, neither deserve,And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,That have this golden chance and know not why.What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!Be not, as is our fangled world, a garmentNobler than that it covers: let thy effectsSo follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,As good as promise.Reads
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece oftender air; and when from a stately cedar shall belopped branches, which, being dead many years,shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock andfreshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.''Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmenTongue and brain not; either both or nothing;Or senseless speaking or a speaking suchAs sense cannot untie. Be what it is,The action of my life is like it, whichI'll keep, if but for sympathy.Re-enter First Gaoler


First Gaoler

Come, sir, are you ready for death?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

First Gaoler

Hanging is the word, sir: ifyou be ready for that, you are well cooked.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

So, if I prove a good repast to thespectators, the dish pays the shot.

First Gaoler

A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,you shall be called to no more payments, fear nomore tavern-bills; which are often the sadness ofparting, as the procuring of mirth: you come inflint for want of meat, depart reeling with toomuch drink; sorry that you have paid too much, andsorry that you are paid too much; purse and brainboth empty; the brain the heavier for being toolight, the purse too light, being drawn ofheaviness: of this contradiction you shall now bequit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums upthousands in a trice: you have no true debitor andcreditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book andcounters; so the acquittance follows.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

First Gaoler

Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not thetooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep yoursleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think hewould change places with his officer; for, look you,sir, you know not which way you shall go.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Yes, indeed do I, fellow.

First Gaoler

Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seenhim so pictured: you must either be directed bysome that take upon them to know, or do take uponyourself that which I am sure you do not know, orjump the after inquiry on your own peril: and howyou shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'llnever return to tell one.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes todirect them the way I am going, but such as wink andwill not use them.

First Gaoler

What an infinite mock is this, that a man shouldhave the best use of eyes to see the way ofblindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.

First Gaoler

I'll be hang'd then.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger


First Gaoler

Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget younggibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on myconscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,for all he be a Roman: and there be some of themtoo that die against their wills; so should I, if Iwere one. I would we were all of one mind, and onemind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers andgallowses! I speak against my present profit, butmy wish hath a preferment in 't.Exeunt

SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.

Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants


CYMBELINE

Stand by my side, you whom the gods have madePreservers of my throne. Woe is my heartThat the poor soldier that so richly fought,Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breastStepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:He shall be happy that can find him, ifOur grace can make him so.

BELARIUS

I never sawSuch noble fury in so poor a thing;Such precious deeds in one that promises noughtBut beggary and poor looks.

CYMBELINE

No tidings of him?

PISANIO

He hath been search'd among the dead and living,But no trace of him.

CYMBELINE

To my grief, I amThe heir of his reward;To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
which I will addTo you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the timeTo ask of whence you are. Report it.

BELARIUS

Sir,In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:Further to boast were neither true nor modest,Unless I add, we are honest.

CYMBELINE

Bow your knees.Arise my knights o' the battle: I create youCompanions to our person and will fit youWith dignities becoming your estates.Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies
There's business in these faces. Why so sadlyGreet you our victory? you look like Romans,And not o' the court of Britain.

CORNELIUS

Hail, great king!To sour your happiness, I must reportThe queen is dead.

CYMBELINE

Who worse than a physicianWould this report become? But I consider,By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet deathWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?

CORNELIUS

With horror, madly dying, like her life,Which, being cruel to the world, concludedMost cruel to herself. What she confess'dI will report, so please you: these her womenCan trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeksWere present when she finish'd.

CYMBELINE

Prithee, say.

CORNELIUS

First, she confess'd she never loved you, onlyAffected greatness got by you, not you:Married your royalty, was wife to your place;Abhorr'd your person.

CYMBELINE

She alone knew this;And, but she spoke it dying, I would notBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.

CORNELIUS

Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to loveWith such integrity, she did confessWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,But that her flight prevented it, she hadTa'en off by poison.

CYMBELINE

O most delicate fiend!Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?

CORNELIUS

More, sir, and worse. She did confess she hadFor you a mortal mineral; which, being took,Should by the minute feed on life and lingeringBy inches waste you: in which time she purposed,By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, toO'ercome you with her show, and in time,When she had fitted you with her craft, to workHer son into the adoption of the crown:But, failing of her end by his strange absence,Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despiteOf heaven and men, her purposes; repentedThe evils she hatch'd were not effected; soDespairing died.

CYMBELINE

                  Heard you all this, her women?

First Lady

We did, so please your highness.

CYMBELINE

Mine eyesWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,That thought her like her seeming; it hadbeen viciousTo have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other  Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN
Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute thatThe Britons have razed out, though with the lossOf many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suitThat their good souls may be appeased with slaughterOf you their captives, which ourself have granted:So think of your estate.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Consider, sir, the chance of war: the dayWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,We should not, when the blood was cool,have threaten'dOur prisoners with the sword. But since the godsWill have it thus, that nothing but our livesMay be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficethA Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:Augustus lives to think on't: and so muchFor my peculiar care. This one thing onlyI will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,Let him be ransom'd: never master hadA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,So tender over his occasions, true,So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue joinWith my request, which I make bold your highnessCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,And spare no blood beside.

CYMBELINE

I have surely seen him:His favour is familiar to me. Boy,Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,The noblest ta'en.

IMOGEN

                  I humbly thank your highness.

CAIUS LUCIUS

I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;And yet I know thou wilt.

IMOGEN

No, no: alack,There's other work in hand: I see a thingBitter to me as death: your life, good master,Must shuffle for itself.

CAIUS LUCIUS

The boy disdains me,He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joysThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.Why stands he so perplex'd?

CYMBELINE

What wouldst thou, boy?I love thee more and more: think more and moreWhat's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

IMOGEN

He is a Roman; no more kin to meThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,Am something nearer.

CYMBELINE

Wherefore eyest him so?

IMOGEN

I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you pleaseTo give me hearing.

CYMBELINE

Ay, with all my heart,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

IMOGEN

Fidele, sir.

CYMBELINE

                  Thou'rt my good youth, my page;I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart


BELARIUS

Is not this boy revived from death?

ARVIRAGUS

One sand anotherNot more resembles that sweet rosy ladWho died, and was Fidele. What think you?

GUIDERIUS

The same dead thing alive.

BELARIUS

Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sureHe would have spoke to us.

GUIDERIUS

But we saw him dead.

BELARIUS

Be silent; let's see further.

PISANIO

[Aside]	It is my mistress:Since she is living, let the time run onTo good or bad.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward


CYMBELINE

                  Come, stand thou by our side;Make thy demand aloud.To IACHIMO
Sir, step you forth;Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,Which is our honour, bitter torture shallWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

IMOGEN

My boon is, that this gentleman may renderOf whom he had this ring.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

[Aside]                 What's that to him?

CYMBELINE

That diamond upon your finger, sayHow came it yours?

IACHIMO

Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken thatWhich, to be spoke, would torture thee.

CYMBELINE

How! me?

IACHIMO

I am glad to be constrain'd to utter thatWhich torments me to conceal. By villanyI got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;Whom thou didst banish; and--which more maygrieve thee,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

CYMBELINE

All that belongs to this.

IACHIMO

That paragon, thy daughter,--For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spiritsQuail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.

CYMBELINE

My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:I had rather thou shouldst live while nature willThan die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.

IACHIMO

Upon a time,--unhappy was the clockThat struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursedThe mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, wouldOur viands had been poison'd, or at leastThose which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--What should I say? he was too good to beWhere ill men were; and was the best of allAmongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,Hearing us praise our loves of ItalyFor beauty that made barren the swell'd boastOf him that best could speak, for feature, lamingThe shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,A shop of all the qualities that manLoves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,Fairness which strikes the eye--

CYMBELINE

I stand on fire:Come to the matter.

IACHIMO

All too soon I shall,Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,Most like a noble lord in love and oneThat had a royal lover, took his hint;And, not dispraising whom we praised,--thereinHe was as calm as virtue--he beganHis mistress' picture; which by his tonguebeing made,And then a mind put in't, either our bragsWere crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his descriptionProved us unspeaking sots.

CYMBELINE

Nay, nay, to the purpose.

IACHIMO

Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with himPieces of gold 'gainst this which then he woreUpon his honour'd finger, to attainIn suit the place of's bed and win this ringBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,No lesser of her honour confidentThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;And would so, had it been a carbuncleOf Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had itBeen all the worth of's car. Away to BritainPost I in this design: well may you, sir,Remember me at court; where I was taughtOf your chaste daughter the wide difference'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'dOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain'Gan in your duller Britain operateMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent:And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,That I return'd with simular proof enoughTo make the noble Leonatus mad,By wounding his belief in her renownWith tokens thus, and thus; averting notesOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marksOf secret on her person, that he could notBut think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--Methinks, I see him now--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,Egregious murderer, thief, any thingThat's due to all the villains past, in being,To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send outFor torturers ingenious: it is IThat all the abhorred things o' the earth amendBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--That caused a lesser villain than myself,A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the templeOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, setThe dogs o' the street to bay me: every villainBe call'd Posthumus Leonitus; andBe villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,Imogen, Imogen!

IMOGEN

                  Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,There lie thy part.Striking her: she falls


PISANIO

O, gentlemen, help!Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!Mine honour'd lady!

CYMBELINE

Does the world go round?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

How come these staggers on me?

PISANIO

Wake, my mistress!

CYMBELINE

If this be so, the gods do mean to strike meTo death with mortal joy.

PISANIO

How fares thy mistress?

IMOGEN

O, get thee from my sight;Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!Breathe not where princes are.

CYMBELINE

The tune of Imogen!

PISANIO

Lady,The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, ifThat box I gave you was not thought by meA precious thing: I had it from the queen.

CYMBELINE

New matter still?

IMOGEN

                  It poison'd me.

CORNELIUS

O gods!I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.Which must approve thee honest: 'If PisanioHave,' said she, 'given his mistress that confectionWhich I gave him for cordial, she is servedAs I would serve a rat.'

CYMBELINE

What's this, Comelius?

CORNELIUS

The queen, sir, very oft importuned meTo temper poisons for her, still pretendingThe satisfaction of her knowledge onlyIn killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purposeWas of more danger, did compound for herA certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would ceaseThe present power of life, but in short timeAll offices of nature should againDo their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

IMOGEN

Most like I did, for I was dead.

BELARIUS

My boys,There was our error.

GUIDERIUS

This is, sure, Fidele.

IMOGEN

Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?Think that you are upon a rock; and nowThrow me again.Embracing him


POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Hang there like a fruit, my soul,Till the tree die!

CYMBELINE

                  How now, my flesh, my child!What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?Wilt thou not speak to me?

IMOGEN

[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.

BELARIUS

[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did lovethis youth, I blame ye not:You had a motive for't.

CYMBELINE

My tears that fallProve holy water on thee! Imogen,Thy mother's dead.

IMOGEN

I am sorry for't, my lord.

CYMBELINE

O, she was nought; and long of her it wasThat we meet here so strangely: but her sonIs gone, we know not how nor where.

PISANIO

My lord,Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,Upon my lady's missing, came to meWith his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,If I discover'd not which way she was gone,It was my instant death. By accident,had a feigned letter of my master'sThen in my pocket; which directed himTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,Which he enforced from me, away he postsWith unchaste purpose and with oath to violateMy lady's honour: what became of himI further know not.

GUIDERIUS

Let me end the story:I slew him there.

CYMBELINE

Marry, the gods forfend!I would not thy good deeds should from my lipsPluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,Deny't again.

GUIDERIUS

                  I have spoke it, and I did it.

CYMBELINE

He was a prince.

GUIDERIUS

A most incivil one: the wrongs he did meWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke meWith language that would make me spurn the sea,If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;And am right glad he is not standing hereTo tell this tale of mine.

CYMBELINE

I am sorry for thee:By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and mustEndure our law: thou'rt dead.

IMOGEN

That headless manI thought had been my lord.

CYMBELINE

Bind the offender,And take him from our presence.

BELARIUS

Stay, sir king:This man is better than the man he slew,As well descended as thyself; and hathMore of thee merited than a band of ClotensHad ever scar for.To the Guard
Let his arms alone;They were not born for bondage.

CYMBELINE

Why, old soldier,Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,By tasting of our wrath? How of descentAs good as we?

ARVIRAGUS

                  In that he spake too far.

CYMBELINE

And thou shalt die for't.

BELARIUS

We will die all three:But I will prove that two on's are as goodAs I have given out him. My sons, I must,For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,Though, haply, well for you.

ARVIRAGUS

Your danger's ours.

GUIDERIUS

And our good his.

BELARIUS

                  Have at it then, by leave.Thou hadst, great king, a subject whoWas call'd Belarius.

CYMBELINE

What of him? he isA banish'd traitor.

BELARIUS

He it is that hathAssumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;I know not how a traitor.

CYMBELINE

Take him hence:The whole world shall not save him.

BELARIUS

Not too hot:First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;And let it be confiscate all, so soonAs I have received it.

CYMBELINE

Nursing of my sons!

BELARIUS

I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,These two young gentlemen, that call me fatherAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;They are the issue of your loins, my liege,And blood of your begetting.

CYMBELINE

How! my issue!

BELARIUS

So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishmentItself, and all my treason; that I suffer'dWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes--For such and so they are--these twenty yearsHave I train'd up: those arts they have as ICould put into them; my breeding was, sir, asYour highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these childrenUpon my banishment: I moved her to't,Having received the punishment before,For that which I did then: beaten for loyaltyExcited me to treason: their dear loss,The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shapedUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,Here are your sons again; and I must loseTwo of the sweet'st companions in the world.The benediction of these covering heavensFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthyTo inlay heaven with stars.

CYMBELINE

Thou weep'st, and speak'st.The service that you three have done is moreUnlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:If these be they, I know not how to wishA pair of worthier sons.

BELARIUS

Be pleased awhile.This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'dIn a most curious mantle, wrought by the handOf his queen mother, which for more probationI can with ease produce.

CYMBELINE

Guiderius hadUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;It was a mark of wonder.

BELARIUS

This is he;Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:It was wise nature's end in the donation,To be his evidence now.

CYMBELINE

O, what, am IA mother to the birth of three? Ne'er motherRejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,That, after this strange starting from your orbs,may reign in them now! O Imogen,Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

IMOGEN

No, my lord;I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,Have we thus met? O, never say hereafterBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,When I was but your sister; I you brothers,When ye were so indeed.

CYMBELINE

Did you e'er meet?

ARVIRAGUS

Ay, my good lord.

GUIDERIUS

                  And at first meeting loved;Continued so, until we thought he died.

CORNELIUS

By the queen's dram she swallow'd.

CYMBELINE

O rare instinct!When shall I hear all through? This fierceabridgementHath to it circumstantial branches, whichDistinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?And when came you to serve our Roman captive?How parted with your brothers? how first met them?Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,And your three motives to the battle, withI know not how much more, should be demanded;And all the other by-dependencies,From chance to chance: but nor the time nor placeWill serve our long inter'gatories. See,Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eyeOn him, her brother, me, her master, hittingEach object with a joy: the counterchangeIs severally in all. Let's quit this ground,And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.To BELARIUS
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

IMOGEN

You are my father too, and did relieve me,To see this gracious season.

CYMBELINE

All o'erjoy'd,Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,For they shall taste our comfort.

IMOGEN

My good master,I will yet do you service.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Happy be you!

CYMBELINE

The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,He would have well becomed this place, and gracedThe thankings of a king.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

I am, sir,The soldier that did company these threeIn poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment forThe purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and mightHave made you finish.

IACHIMO

[Kneeling]          I am down again:But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,Which I so often owe: but your ring first;And here the bracelet of the truest princessThat ever swore her faith.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Kneel not to me:The power that I have on you is, to spare you;The malice towards you to forgive you: live,And deal with others better.

CYMBELINE

Nobly doom'd!We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;Pardon's the word to all.

ARVIRAGUS

You holp us, sir,As you did mean indeed to be our brother;Joy'd are we that you are.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methoughtGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,Appear'd to me, with other spritely showsOf mine own kindred: when I waked, I foundThis label on my bosom; whose containingIs so from sense in hardness, that I canMake no collection of it: let him showHis skill in the construction.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Philarmonus!

Soothsayer

Here, my good lord.

CAIUS LUCIUS

Read, and declare the meaning.

Soothsayer

[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himselfunknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by apiece of tender air; and when from a stately cedarshall be lopped branches, which, being dead manyyears, shall after revive, be jointed to the oldstock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus endhis miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish inpeace and plenty.'Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;The fit and apt construction of thy name,Being Leonatus, doth import so much.To CYMBELINE
The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divineIs this most constant wife; who, even now,Answering the letter of the oracle,Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd aboutWith this most tender air.

CYMBELINE

This hath some seeming.

Soothsayer

The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches pointThy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,For many years thought dead, are now revived,To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issuePromises Britain peace and plenty.

CYMBELINE

WellMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,And to the Roman empire; promisingTo pay our wonted tribute, from the whichWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen;Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,Have laid most heavy hand.

Soothsayer

The fingers of the powers above do tuneThe harmony of this peace. The visionWhich I made known to Lucius, ere the strokeOf this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instantIs full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,From south to west on wing soaring aloft,Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sunSo vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,The imperial Caesar, should again uniteHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,Which shines here in the west.

CYMBELINE

Laud we the gods;And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrilsFrom our blest altars. Publish we this peaceTo all our subjects. Set we forward: letA Roman and a British ensign waveFriendly together: so through Lud's-town march:And in the temple of great JupiterOur peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.Set on there! Never was a war did cease,Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.Exeunt
