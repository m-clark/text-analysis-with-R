Warkworth. Before the castle


Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues


RUMOUR

Open your ears; for which of you will stopThe vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?I, from the orient to the drooping west,Making the wind my post-horse, still unfoldThe acts commenced on this ball of earth:Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,The which in every language I pronounce,Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.I speak of peace, while covert enmityUnder the smile of safety wounds the world:And who but Rumour, who but only I,Make fearful musters and prepared defence,Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,And no such matter? Rumour is a pipeBlown by surmises, jealousies, conjecturesAnd of so easy and so plain a stopThat the blunt monster with uncounted heads,The still-discordant wavering multitude,Can play upon it. But what need I thusMy well-known body to anatomizeAmong my household? Why is Rumour here?I run before King Harry's victory;Who in a bloody field by ShrewsburyHath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,Quenching the flame of bold rebellionEven with the rebel's blood. But what mean ITo speak so true at first? my office isTo noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fellUnder the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,And that the king before the Douglas' rageStoop'd his anointed head as low as death.This have I rumour'd through the peasant townsBetween that royal field of ShrewsburyAnd this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,And not a man of them brings other newsThan they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tonguesThey bring smooth comforts false, worse thantrue wrongs.Exit

SCENE I. The same.

Enter LORD BARDOLPH


LORD BARDOLPH

Who keeps the gate here, ho?The Porter opens the gate
Where is the earl?

Porter

What shall I say you are?

LORD BARDOLPH

Tell thou the earlThat the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

Porter

His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,And he himself wilt answer.Enter NORTHUMBERLAND


LORD BARDOLPH

Here comes the earl.Exit Porter


NORTHUMBERLAND

What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute nowShould be the father of some stratagem:The times are wild: contention, like a horseFull of high feeding, madly hath broke looseAnd bears down all before him.

LORD BARDOLPH

Noble earl,I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Good, an God will!

LORD BARDOLPH

                  As good as heart can wish:The king is almost wounded to the death;And, in the fortune of my lord your son,Prince Harry slain outright; and both the BluntsKill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince JohnAnd Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,Came not till now to dignify the times,Since Caesar's fortunes!

NORTHUMBERLAND

How is this derived?Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?

LORD BARDOLPH

I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,A gentleman well bred and of good name,That freely render'd me these news for true.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sentOn Tuesday last to listen after news.Enter TRAVERS


LORD BARDOLPH

My lord, I over-rode him on the way;And he is furnish'd with no certaintiesMore than he haply may retail from me.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?

TRAVERS

My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me backWith joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,Out-rode me. After him came spurring hardA gentleman, almost forspent with speed,That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.He ask'd the way to Chester; and of himI did demand what news from Shrewsbury:He told me that rebellion had bad luckAnd that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.With that, he gave his able horse the head,And bending forward struck his armed heelsAgainst the panting sides of his poor jadeUp to the rowel-head, and starting soHe seem'd in running to devour the way,Staying no longer question.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Ha! Again:Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellionHad met ill luck?

LORD BARDOLPH

                  My lord, I'll tell you what;If my young lord your son have not the day,Upon mine honour, for a silken pointI'll give my barony: never talk of it.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Why should that gentleman that rode by TraversGive then such instances of loss?

LORD BARDOLPH

Who, he?He was some hilding fellow that had stolenThe horse he rode on, and, upon my life,Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.Enter MORTON


NORTHUMBERLAND

Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:So looks the strand whereon the imperious floodHath left a witness'd usurpation.Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?

MORTON

I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;Where hateful death put on his ugliest maskTo fright our party.

NORTHUMBERLAND

How doth my son and brother?Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheekIs apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'

MORTON

Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;But, for my lord your son--

NORTHUMBERLAND

Why, he is dead.See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!He that but fears the thing he would not knowHath by instinct knowledge from others' eyesThat what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;Tell thou an earl his divination lies,And I will take it as a sweet disgraceAnd make thee rich for doing me such wrong.

MORTON

You are too great to be by me gainsaid:Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.I see a strange confession in thine eye:Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sinTo speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;The tongue offends not that reports his death:And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,Not he which says the dead is not alive.Yet the first bringer of unwelcome newsHath but a losing office, and his tongueSounds ever after as a sullen bell,Remember'd tolling a departing friend.

LORD BARDOLPH

I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

MORTON

I am sorry I should force you to believeThat which I would to God I had not seen;But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat downThe never-daunted Percy to the earth,From whence with life he never more sprung up.In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fireEven to the dullest peasant in his camp,Being bruited once, took fire and heat awayFrom the best temper'd courage in his troops;For from his metal was his party steel'd;Which once in him abated, all the restTurn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:And as the thing that's heavy in itself,Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,Lend to this weight such lightness with their fearThat arrows fled not swifter toward their aimThan did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,Fly from the field. Then was the noble WorcesterToo soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring swordHad three times slain the appearance of the king,'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shameOf those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of allIs that the king hath won, and hath sent outA speedy power to encounter you, my lord,Under the conduct of young LancasterAnd Westmoreland. This is the news at full.

NORTHUMBERLAND

For this I shall have time enough to mourn.In poison there is physic; and these news,Having been well, that would have made me sick,Being sick, have in some measure made me well:And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fireOut of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steelMust glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!Thou art a guard too wanton for the headWhich princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.Now bind my brows with iron; and approachThe ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bringTo frown upon the enraged Northumberland!Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's handKeep the wild flood confined! let order die!And let this world no longer be a stageTo feed contention in a lingering act;But let one spirit of the first-born CainReign in all bosoms, that, each heart being setOn bloody courses, the rude scene may end,And darkness be the burier of the dead!

TRAVERS

This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.

LORD BARDOLPH

Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.

MORTON

The lives of all your loving complicesLean on your health; the which, if you give o'erTo stormy passion, must perforce decay.You cast the event of war, my noble lord,And summ'd the account of chance, before you said'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,More likely to fall in than to get o'er;You were advised his flesh was capableOf wounds and scars and that his forward spiritWould lift him where most trade of danger ranged:Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,Though strongly apprehended, could restrainThe stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,More than that being which was like to be?

LORD BARDOLPH

We all that are engaged to this lossKnew that we ventured on such dangerous seasThat if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;And yet we ventured, for the gain proposedChoked the respect of likely peril fear'd;And since we are o'erset, venture again.Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.

MORTON

'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,The gentle Archbishop of York is upWith well-appointed powers: he is a manWho with a double surety binds his followers.My lord your son had only but the corpse,But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;For that same word, rebellion, did divideThe action of their bodies from their souls;And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,As men drink potions, that their weapons onlySeem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,As fish are in a pond. But now the bishopTurns insurrection to religion:Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,He's followed both with body and with mind;And doth enlarge his rising with the bloodOf fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;And more and less do flock to follow him.

NORTHUMBERLAND

I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,This present grief had wiped it from my mind.Go in with me; and counsel every manThe aptest way for safety and revenge:Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:Never so few, and never yet more need.Exeunt

SCENE II. London. A street.

Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler


FALSTAFF

Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?

Page

He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthywater; but, for the party that owed it, he mighthave more diseases than he knew for.

FALSTAFF

Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: thebrain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is notable to invent anything that tends to laughter, morethan I invent or is invented on me: I am not onlywitty in myself, but the cause that wit is in othermen. I do here walk before thee like a sow thathath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If theprince put thee into my service for any other reasonthan to set me off, why then I have no judgment.Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be wornin my cap than to wait at my heels. I was nevermanned with an agate till now: but I will inset youneither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, andsend you back again to your master, for a jewel,--the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin isnot yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow inthe palm of my hand than he shall get one on hischeek; and yet he will not stick to say his face isa face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tisnot a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at aface-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpenceout of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he hadwrit man ever since his father was a bachelor. Hemay keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon aboutthe satin for my short cloak and my slops?

Page

He said, sir, you should procure him betterassurance than Bardolph: he would not take hisband and yours; he liked not the security.

FALSTAFF

Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God histongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascallyyea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,and then stand upon security! The whoresonsmooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, andbunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man isthrough with them in honest taking up, then theymust stand upon security. I had as lief they wouldput ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it withsecurity. I looked a' should have sent me two andtwenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and hesends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightnessof his wife shines through it: and yet cannot hesee, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.Where's Bardolph?

Page

He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.

FALSTAFF

I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse inSmithfield: an I could get me but a wife in thestews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant


Page

Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed thePrince for striking him about Bardolph.

FALSTAFF

Wait, close; I will not see him.Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there?

Servant

Falstaff, an't please your lordship.Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery?

Servant

He, my lord: but he hath since done good service atShrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with somecharge to the Lord John of Lancaster.Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again.

Servant

Sir John Falstaff!

FALSTAFF

Boy, tell him I am deaf.

Page

You must speak louder; my master is deaf.Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.

Servant

Sir John!

FALSTAFF

What! a young knave, and begging! Is there notwars? is there not employment? doth not the kinglack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, itis worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,were it worse than the name of rebellion can tellhow to make it.

Servant

You mistake me, sir.

FALSTAFF

Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? settingmy knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had liedin my throat, if I had said so.

Servant

I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and oursoldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,you lie in your throat, if you say I am any otherthan an honest man.

FALSTAFF

I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside thatwhich grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better behanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!

Servant

Sir, my lord would speak with you.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.

FALSTAFF

My good lord! God give your lordship good time ofday. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heardsay your lordship was sick: I hope your lordshipgoes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though notclean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age inyou, some relish of the saltness of time; and I musthumbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent careof your health.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition toShrewsbury.

FALSTAFF

An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty isreturned with some discomfort from Wales.Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come whenI sent for you.

FALSTAFF

And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen intothis same whoreson apoplexy.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak withyou.

FALSTAFF

This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in theblood, a whoreson tingling.Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.

FALSTAFF

It hath its original from much grief, from study andperturbation of the brain: I have read the cause ofhis effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for youhear not what I say to you.

FALSTAFF

Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't pleaseyou, it is the disease of not listening, the maladyof not marking, that I am troubled withal.Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend theattention of your ears; and I care not if I dobecome your physician.

FALSTAFF

I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:your lordship may minister the potion ofimprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but howshould I be your patient to follow yourprescriptions, the wise may make some dram of ascruple, or indeed a scruple itself.Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against youfor your life, to come speak with me.

FALSTAFF

As I was then advised by my learned counsel in thelaws of this land-service, I did not come.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.

FALSTAFF

He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.

FALSTAFF

I would it were otherwise; I would my means weregreater, and my waist slenderer.Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince.

FALSTAFF

The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellowwith the great belly, and he my dog.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: yourday's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gildedover your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you maythank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-postingthat action.

FALSTAFF

My lord?Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not asleeping wolf.

FALSTAFF

To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burntout.

FALSTAFF

A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did sayof wax, my growth would approve the truth.Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but shouldhave his effect of gravity.

FALSTAFF

His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like hisill angel.

FALSTAFF

Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hopehe that looks upon me will take me without weighing:and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: Icannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in thesecostermonger times that true valour is turnedbear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hathhis quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all theother gifts appertinent to man, as the malice ofthis age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.You that are old consider not the capacities of usthat are young; you do measure the heat of ourlivers with the bitterness of your galls: and wethat are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,are wags too.Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,that are written down old with all the characters ofage? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? ayellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? anincreasing belly? is not your voice broken? yourwind short? your chin double? your wit single? andevery part about you blasted with antiquity? andwill you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!

FALSTAFF

My lord, I was born about three of the clock in theafternoon, with a white head and something a roundbelly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloingand singing of anthems. To approve my youthfurther, I will not: the truth is, I am only old injudgment and understanding; and he that will caperwith me for a thousand marks, let him lend me themoney, and have at him! For the box of the ear thatthe prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,and you took it like a sensible lord. I havechequed him for it, and the young lion repents;marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silkand old sack.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion!

FALSTAFF

God send the companion a better prince! I cannotrid my hands of him.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: Ihear you are going with Lord John of Lancasteragainst the Archbishop and the Earl ofNorthumberland.

FALSTAFF

Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But lookyou pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by theLord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I meannot to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would Imight never spit white again. There is not adangerous action can peep out his head but I amthrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but itwas alway yet the trick of our English nation, ifthey have a good thing, to make it too common. Ifye will needs say I am an old man, you should giveme rest. I would to God my name were not soterrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to beeaten to death with a rust than to be scoured tonothing with perpetual motion.Lord Chief-Justice	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless yourexpedition!

FALSTAFF

Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound tofurnish me forth?Lord Chief-Justice	Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient tobear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to mycousin Westmoreland.Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant


FALSTAFF

If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A mancan no more separate age and covetousness than a'can part young limbs and lechery: but the goutgalls the one, and the pox pinches the other; andso both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!

Page

Sir?

FALSTAFF

What money is in my purse?

Page

Seven groats and two pence.

FALSTAFF

I can get no remedy against this consumption of thepurse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letterto my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; thisto the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to oldMistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marrysince I perceived the first white hair on my chin.About it: you know where to find me.Exit Page
A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! forthe one or the other plays the rogue with my greattoe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the warsfor my colour, and my pension shall seem the morereasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:I will turn diseases to commodity.Exit

SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace.

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?

MOWBRAY

I well allow the occasion of our arms;But gladly would be better satisfiedHow in our means we should advance ourselvesTo look with forehead bold and big enoughUpon the power and puissance of the king.

HASTINGS

Our present musters grow upon the fileTo five and twenty thousand men of choice;And our supplies live largely in the hopeOf great Northumberland, whose bosom burnsWith an incensed fire of injuries.

LORD BARDOLPH

The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;Whether our present five and twenty thousandMay hold up head without Northumberland?

HASTINGS

With him, we may.

LORD BARDOLPH

                  Yea, marry, there's the point:But if without him we be thought too feeble,My judgment is, we should not step too farTill we had his assistance by the hand;For in a theme so bloody-faced as thisConjecture, expectation, and surmiseOf aids incertain should not be admitted.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeedIt was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

LORD BARDOLPH

It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,Eating the air on promise of supply,Flattering himself in project of a powerMuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:And so, with great imaginationProper to madmen, led his powers to deathAnd winking leap'd into destruction.

HASTINGS

But, by your leave, it never yet did hurtTo lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.

LORD BARDOLPH

Yes, if this present quality of war,Indeed the instant action: a cause on footLives so in hope as in an early springWe see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,Hope gives not so much warrant as despairThat frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,We first survey the plot, then draw the model;And when we see the figure of the house,Then must we rate the cost of the erection;Which if we find outweighs ability,What do we then but draw anew the modelIn fewer offices, or at last desistTo build at all? Much more, in this great work,Which is almost to pluck a kingdom downAnd set another up, should we surveyThe plot of situation and the model,Consent upon a sure foundation,Question surveyors, know our own estate,How able such a work to undergo,To weigh against his opposite; or elseWe fortify in paper and in figures,Using the names of men instead of men:Like one that draws the model of a houseBeyond his power to build it; who, half through,Gives o'er and leaves his part-created costA naked subject to the weeping cloudsAnd waste for churlish winter's tyranny.

HASTINGS

Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,Should be still-born, and that we now possess'dThe utmost man of expectation,I think we are a body strong enough,Even as we are, to equal with the king.

LORD BARDOLPH

What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?

HASTINGS

To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.For his divisions, as the times do brawl,Are in three heads: one power against the French,And one against Glendower; perforce a thirdMust take up us: so is the unfirm kingIn three divided; and his coffers soundWith hollow poverty and emptiness.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

That he should draw his several strengths togetherAnd come against us in full puissance,Need not be dreaded.

HASTINGS

If he should do so,He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and WelshBaying him at the heels: never fear that.

LORD BARDOLPH

Who is it like should lead his forces hither?

HASTINGS

The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:But who is substituted 'gainst the French,I have no certain notice.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Let us on,And publish the occasion of our arms.The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:An habitation giddy and unsureHath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.O thou fond many, with what loud applauseDidst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorgeThy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,And howl'st to find it. What trust is inthese times?They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,Are now become enamour'd on his grave:Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly headWhen through proud London he came sighing onAfter the admired heels of Bolingbroke,Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!Past and to come seems best; things present worst.

MOWBRAY

Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?

HASTINGS

We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. London. A street.

Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her, and SNARE following.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Master Fang, have you entered the action?

FANG

It is entered.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'stand to 't?

FANG

Sirrah, where's Snare?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.

SNARE

Here, here.

FANG

Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.

SNARE

It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me inmine own house, and that most beastly: in goodfaith, he cares not what mischief he does. If hisweapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he willspare neither man, woman, nor child.

FANG

If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.

FANG

An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--

MISTRESS QUICKLY

I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's aninfinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--savingyour manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited todinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, toMaster Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since myexion is entered and my case so openly known to theworld, let him be brought in to his answer. Ahundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman tobear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, andhave been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbedoff, from this day to that day, that it is a shameto be thought on. There is no honesty in suchdealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and abeast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder hecomes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,with him. Do your offices, do your offices: MasterFang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH


FALSTAFF

How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?

Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.

FALSTAFF

Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off thevillain's head: throw the quean in the channel.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in thechannel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardlyrogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysucklevillain! wilt thou kill God's officers and theking's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art ahoney-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.

FALSTAFF

Keep them off, Bardolph.

FANG

A rescue! a rescue!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo'tthou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,thou hemp-seed!

FALSTAFF

Away, you scullion! you rampallion! Youfustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men
Lord Chief-Justice	What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.Lord Chief-Justice	How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?Doth this become your place, your time and business?You should have been well on your way to York.Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I ama poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.Lord Chief-Justice	For what sum?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;he hath put all my substance into that fat belly ofhis: but I will have some of it out again, or Iwill ride thee o' nights like the mare.

FALSTAFF

I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I haveany vantage of ground to get up.Lord Chief-Justice	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of goodtemper would endure this tempest of exclamation?Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to sorough a course to come by her own?

FALSTAFF

What is the gross sum that I owe thee?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and themoney too. Thou didst swear to me upon aparcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, uponWednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince brokethy head for liking his father to a singing-man ofWindsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I waswashing thy wound, to marry me and make me my ladythy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwifeKeech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call megossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess ofvinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby Itold thee they were ill for a green wound? Anddidst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,desire me to be no more so familiarity with suchpoor people; saying that ere long they should callme madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid mefetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thybook-oath: deny it, if thou canst.

FALSTAFF

My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says upand down the town that the eldest son is like you:she hath been in good case, and the truth is,poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolishofficers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with yourmanner of wrenching the true cause the false way. Itis not a confident brow, nor the throng of wordsthat come with such more than impudent saucinessfrom you, can thrust me from a level consideration:you have, as it appears to me, practised upon theeasy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made herserve your uses both in purse and in person.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Yea, in truth, my lord.Lord Chief-Justice	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, andunpay the villany you have done her: the one youmay do with sterling money, and the other withcurrent repentance.

FALSTAFF

My lord, I will not undergo this sneap withoutreply. You call honourable boldness impudentsauciness: if a man will make courtesy and saynothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humbleduty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I sayto you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.Lord Chief-Justice	You speak as having power to do wrong: but answerin the effect of your reputation, and satisfy thispoor woman.

FALSTAFF

Come hither, hostess.Enter GOWER
Lord Chief-Justice	Now, Master Gower, what news?

GOWER

FALSTAFF

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Faith, you said so before.

FALSTAFF

As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fainto pawn both my plate and the tapestry of mydining-chambers.

FALSTAFF

Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thywalls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story ofthe Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and thesefly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thoucanst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there'snot a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,and draw the action. Come, thou must not be inthis humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, Iknow thou wast set on to this.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,la!

FALSTAFF

Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be afool still.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. Ihope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?

FALSTAFF

GOWER

No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.

FALSTAFF

Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?Lord Chief-Justice	You shall have letters of me presently:Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.

FALSTAFF

My lord!Lord Chief-Justice	What's the matter?

FALSTAFF

Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?

GOWER

I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,good Sir John.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are totake soldiers up in counties as you go.

FALSTAFF

Will you sup with me, Master Gower?Lord Chief-Justice	What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?

FALSTAFF

Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a foolthat taught them me. This is the right fencinggrace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.Lord Chief-Justice	Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.Exeunt

SCENE II. London. Another street.

Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS


PRINCE HENRY

Before God, I am exceeding weary.

POINS

Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst nothave attached one of so high blood.

PRINCE HENRY

Faith, it does me; though it discolours thecomplexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Dothit not show vilely in me to desire small beer?

POINS

Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied asto remember so weak a composition.

PRINCE HENRY

Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,small beer. But, indeed, these humbleconsiderations make me out of love with mygreatness. What a disgrace is it to me to rememberthy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or totake note how many pair of silk stockings thouhast, viz. these, and those that were thypeach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thyshirts, as, one for superfluity, and another foruse! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows betterthan I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee whenthou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not donea great while, because the rest of thy lowcountries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruinsof thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but themidwives say the children are not in the fault;whereupon the world increases, and kindreds aremightily strengthened.

POINS

How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many goodyoung princes would do so, their fathers being sosick as yours at this time is?

PRINCE HENRY

Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?

POINS

Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.

PRINCE HENRY

It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.

POINS

Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that youwill tell.

PRINCE HENRY

Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should besad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tellthee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of abetter, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sadindeed too.

POINS

Very hardly upon such a subject.

PRINCE HENRY

By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil'sbook as thou and Falstaff for obduracy andpersistency: let the end try the man. But I tellthee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is sosick: and keeping such vile company as thou arthath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.

POINS

The reason?

PRINCE HENRY

What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?

POINS

I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.

PRINCE HENRY

It would be every man's thought; and thou art ablessed fellow to think as every man thinks: nevera man's thought in the world keeps the road-waybetter than thine: every man would think me anhypocrite indeed. And what accites your mostworshipful thought to think so?

POINS

Why, because you have been so lewd and so muchengraffed to Falstaff.

PRINCE HENRY

And to thee.

POINS

By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear itwith my own ears: the worst that they can say ofme is that I am a second brother and that I am aproper fellow of my hands; and those two things, Iconfess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.Enter BARDOLPH and Page


PRINCE HENRY

And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him fromme Christian; and look, if the fat villain have nottransformed him ape.

BARDOLPH

God save your grace!

PRINCE HENRY

And yours, most noble Bardolph!

BARDOLPH

Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must yoube blushing? wherefore blush you now? What amaidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such amatter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?

Page

A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a redlattice, and I could discern no part of his facefrom the window: at last I spied his eyes, andmethought he had made two holes in the ale-wife'snew petticoat and so peeped through.

PRINCE HENRY

Has not the boy profited?

BARDOLPH

Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!

Page

Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!

PRINCE HENRY

Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?

Page

Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was deliveredof a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.

PRINCE HENRY

A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,boy.

POINS

O, that this good blossom could be kept fromcankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.

BARDOLPH

An you do not make him hanged among you, thegallows shall have wrong.

PRINCE HENRY

And how doth thy master, Bardolph?

BARDOLPH

Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming totown: there's a letter for you.

POINS

Delivered with good respect. And how doth themartlemas, your master?

BARDOLPH

In bodily health, sir.

POINS

Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; butthat moves not him: though that be sick, it diesnot.

PRINCE HENRY

I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as mydog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.

POINS

[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man mustknow that, as oft as he has occasion to namehimself: even like those that are kin to the king;for they never prick their finger but they say,'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'Howcomes that?' says he, that takes upon him not toconceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower'scap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'

PRINCE HENRY

Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch itfrom Japhet. But to the letter.

POINS

[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son ofthe king, nearest his father, Harry Prince ofWales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.

PRINCE HENRY

Peace!

POINS

[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans inbrevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commendthee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar withPoins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that heswears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repentat idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as tosay, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with myfamiliars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.

PRINCE HENRY

That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But doyou use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?

POINS

God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.

PRINCE HENRY

Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and thespirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.Is your master here in London?

BARDOLPH

Yea, my lord.

PRINCE HENRY

Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?

BARDOLPH

At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.

PRINCE HENRY

What company?

Page

Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.

PRINCE HENRY

Sup any women with him?

Page

None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly andMistress Doll Tearsheet.

PRINCE HENRY

What pagan may that be?

Page

A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.

PRINCE HENRY

Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the townbull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?

POINS

I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.

PRINCE HENRY

Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to yourmaster that I am yet come to town: there's foryour silence.

BARDOLPH

I have no tongue, sir.

Page

And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

PRINCE HENRY

Fare you well; go.Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page
This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.

POINS

I warrant you, as common as the way between SaintAlban's and London.

PRINCE HENRY

How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-nightin his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?

POINS

Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and waitupon him at his table as drawers.

PRINCE HENRY

From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it wasJove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a lowtransformation! that shall be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly.Follow me, Ned.Exeunt

Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY


NORTHUMBERLAND

I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,Give even way unto my rough affairs:Put not you on the visage of the timesAnd be like them to Percy troublesome.LADY

NORTHUMBERLAND

I have given over, I will speak no more:Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.

LADY PERCY

O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!The time was, father, that you broke your word,When you were more endeared to it than now;When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,Threw many a northward look to see his fatherBring up his powers; but he did long in vain.Who then persuaded you to stay at home?There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!For his, it stuck upon him as the sunIn the grey vault of heaven, and by his lightDid all the chivalry of England moveTo do brave acts: he was indeed the glassWherein the noble youth did dress themselves:He had no legs that practised not his gait;And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,Became the accents of the valiant;For those that could speak low and tardilyWould turn their own perfection to abuse,To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,In diet, in affections of delight,In military rules, humours of blood,He was the mark and glass, copy and book,That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!O miracle of men! him did you leave,Second to none, unseconded by you,To look upon the hideous god of warIn disadvantage; to abide a fieldWhere nothing but the sound of Hotspur's nameDid seem defensible: so you left him.Never, O never, do his ghost the wrongTo hold your honour more precise and niceWith others than with him! let them alone:The marshal and the archbishop are strong:Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Beshrew your heart,Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from meWith new lamenting ancient oversights.But I must go and meet with danger there,Or it will seek me in another placeAnd find me worse provided.LADY

NORTHUMBERLAND

O, fly to Scotland,Till that the nobles and the armed commonsHave of their puissance made a little taste.

LADY PERCY

If they get ground and vantage of the king,Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,First let them try themselves. So did your son;He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;And never shall have length of life enoughTo rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,For recordation to my noble husband.

NORTHUMBERLAND

Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mindAs with the tide swell'd up unto his height,That makes a still-stand, running neither way:Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,But many thousand reasons hold me back.I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,Till time and vantage crave my company.Exeunt

Second Drawer

Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dishof apple-johns before him, and told him there werefive more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,old, withered knights.' It angered him to theheart: but he hath forgot that.

Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;do not bid me remember mine end.

DOLL TEARSHEET

Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?

FALSTAFF

A good shallow young fellow: a' would have made agood pantler, a' would ha' chipp'd bread well.

DOLL TEARSHEET

They say Poins has a good wit.

FALSTAFF

He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thickas Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in himthan is in a mallet.

DOLL TEARSHEET

Why does the prince love him so, then?

FALSTAFF

Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, andrides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps uponjoined-stools, and swears with a good grace, andwears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign ofthe leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreetstories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,that show a weak mind and an able body, for thewhich the prince admits him: for the prince himselfis such another; the weight of a hair will turn thescales between their avoirdupois.

PRINCE HENRY

Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?

POINS

Let's beat him before his whore.

PRINCE HENRY

Look, whether the withered elder hath not his pollclawed like a parrot.

POINS

Is it not strange that desire should so many yearsoutlive performance?

FALSTAFF

Kiss me, Doll.

PRINCE HENRY

Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! whatsays the almanac to that?

POINS

And look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be notlisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,his counsel-keeper.

FALSTAFF

Thou dost give me flattering busses.

DOLL TEARSHEET

By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.

FALSTAFF

I am old, I am old.

DOLL TEARSHEET

I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy youngboy of them all.

FALSTAFF

What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receivemoney o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. Amerry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.

DOLL TEARSHEET

By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thousayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsometill thy return: well, harken at the end.

FALSTAFF

Some sack, Francis.

PRINCE HENRY

POINS

Anon, anon, sir.Coming forward


FALSTAFF

Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thouPoins his brother?

PRINCE HENRY

Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a lifedost thou lead!

FALSTAFF

A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.

PRINCE HENRY

Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweetface of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?

FALSTAFF

Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this lightflesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.

DOLL TEARSHEET

How, you fat fool! I scorn you.

POINS

My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge andturn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.

PRINCE HENRY

You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did youspeak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,civil gentlewoman!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,by my troth.

FALSTAFF

Didst thou hear me?

PRINCE HENRY

Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran awayby Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, andspoke it on purpose to try my patience.

FALSTAFF

No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.

PRINCE HENRY

I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;and then I know how to handle you.

FALSTAFF

No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.

PRINCE HENRY

Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier andbread-chipper and I know not what?

FALSTAFF

No abuse, Hal.

POINS

No abuse?

FALSTAFF

No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. Idispraised him before the wicked, that the wickedmight not fall in love with him; in which doing, Ihave done the part of a careful friend and a truesubject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.

PRINCE HENRY

See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice dothnot make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman toclose with us? is she of the wicked? is thinehostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of thewicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in hisnose, of the wicked?

POINS

Answer, thou dead elm, answer.

FALSTAFF

The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where hedoth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,there is a good angel about him; but the deviloutbids him too.

PRINCE HENRY

For the women?

FALSTAFF

For one of them, she is in hell already, and burnspoor souls. For the other, I owe her money, andwhether she be damned for that, I know not.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

No, I warrant you.

FALSTAFF

No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit forthat. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton ortwo in a whole Lent?

PRINCE HENRY

You, gentlewoman,-

DOLL TEARSHEET

What says your grace?

FALSTAFF

His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.Knocking within


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Francis.Enter PETO


PRINCE HENRY

Peto, how now! what news?

PETO

The king your father is at Westminster:And there are twenty weak and wearied postsCome from the north: and, as I came along,I met and overtook a dozen captains,Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.

PRINCE HENRY

By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,So idly to profane the precious time,When tempest of commotion, like the southBorne with black vapour, doth begin to meltAnd drop upon our bare unarmed heads.Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.Exeunt PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH


FALSTAFF

Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, andwe must hence and leave it unpicked.Knocking within
More knocking at the door!Re-enter BARDOLPH
How now! what's the matter?

BARDOLPH

You must away to court, sir, presently;A dozen captains stay at door for you.

FALSTAFF

[To the Page]  Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,how men of merit are sought after: the undeservermay sleep, when the man of action is called on.Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,I will see you again ere I go.

DOLL TEARSHEET

I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.

FALSTAFF

Farewell, farewell.Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Well, fare thee well: I have known thee thesetwenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but anhonester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.

BARDOLPH

[Within]  Mistress Tearsheet!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

What's the matter?

BARDOLPH

[Within]  Good Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll: come.She comes blubbered
Yea, will you come, Doll?Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Westminster. The palace.

Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page


KING HENRY IV

Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,And well consider of them; make good speed.Exit Page
How many thousand of my poorest subjectsAre at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids downAnd steep my senses in forgetfulness?Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,Upon uneasy pallets stretching theeAnd hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,Under the canopies of costly state,And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vileIn loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couchA watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mastSeal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brainsIn cradle of the rude imperious surgeAnd in the visitation of the winds,Who take the ruffian billows by the top,Curling their monstrous heads and hanging themWith deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy reposeTo the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,And in the calmest and most stillest night,With all appliances and means to boot,Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.Enter WARWICK and SURREY


WARWICK

Many good morrows to your majesty!

KING HENRY IV

Is it good morrow, lords?

WARWICK

'Tis one o'clock, and past.

KING HENRY IV

Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

WARWICK

We have, my liege.

KING HENRY IV

Then you perceive the body of our kingdomHow foul it is; what rank diseases growAnd with what danger, near the heart of it.

WARWICK

It is but as a body yet distemper'd;Which to his former strength may be restoredWith good advice and little medicine:My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.

KING HENRY IV

O God! that one might read the book of fate,And see the revolution of the timesMake mountains level, and the continent,Weary of solid firmness, melt itselfInto the sea! and, other times, to seeThe beachy girdle of the oceanToo wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,And changes fill the cup of alterationWith divers liquors! O, if this were seen,The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,What perils past, what crosses to ensue,Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.'Tis not 'ten years goneSince Richard and Northumberland, great friends,Did feast together, and in two years afterWere they at wars: it is but eight years sinceThis Percy was the man nearest my soul,Who like a brother toil'd in my affairsAnd laid his love and life under my foot,Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of RichardGave him defiance. But which of you was by--You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--To WARWICK
When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?'Northumberland, thou ladder by the whichMy cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,But that necessity so bow'd the stateThat I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,Shall break into corruption:' so went on,Foretelling this same time's conditionAnd the division of our amity.

WARWICK

There is a history in all men's lives,Figuring the nature of the times deceased;The which observed, a man may prophesy,With a near aim, of the main chance of thingsAs yet not come to life, which in their seedsAnd weak beginnings lie intreasured.Such things become the hatch and brood of time;And by the necessary form of thisKing Richard might create a perfect guessThat great Northumberland, then false to him,Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;Which should not find a ground to root upon,Unless on you.

KING HENRY IV

                  Are these things then necessities?Then let us meet them like necessities:And that same word even now cries out on us:They say the bishop and NorthumberlandAre fifty thousand strong.

WARWICK

It cannot be, my lord;Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your graceTo go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,The powers that you already have sent forthShall bring this prize in very easily.To comfort you the more, I have receivedA certain instance that Glendower is dead.Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,And these unseason'd hours perforce must addUnto your sickness.

KING HENRY IV

I will take your counsel:And were these inward wars once out of hand,We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.Exeunt

SCENE II. Gloucestershire. Before SHALLOW'S house.

Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY,  SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE, BULLCALF, a Servant or two with them


SHALLOW

Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, bythe rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?

SILENCE

Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.

SHALLOW

And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and yourfairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?

SILENCE

Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!

SHALLOW

By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William isbecome a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?

SILENCE

Indeed, sir, to my cost.

SHALLOW

A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I wasonce of Clement's Inn, where I think they willtalk of mad Shallow yet.

SILENCE

You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.

SHALLOW

By the mass, I was called any thing; and I wouldhave done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, andWill Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four suchswinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: andI may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas wereand had the best of them all at commandment. Thenwas Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page toThomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

SILENCE

This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?

SHALLOW

The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him breakSkogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was acrack not thus high: and the very same day did Ifight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that Ihave spent! and to see how many of my oldacquaintance are dead!

SILENCE

We shall all follow, cousin.

SHADOW

Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shalldie. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?

SILENCE

By my troth, I was not there.

SHALLOW

Death is certain. Is old Double of your town livingyet?

SILENCE

Dead, sir.

SHALLOW

Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, andbetted much money on his head. Dead! a' would haveclapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carriedyou a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and ahalf, that it would have done a man's heart good tosee. How a score of ewes now?

SILENCE

Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may beworth ten pounds.

SHALLOW

And is old Double dead?

SILENCE

Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.Enter BARDOLPH and one with him


BARDOLPH

Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, whichis Justice Shallow?

SHALLOW

I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of thiscounty, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:What is your good pleasure with me?

BARDOLPH

My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, anda most gallant leader.

SHALLOW

He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backswordman. How doth the good knight? may I ask how mylady his wife doth?

BARDOLPH

Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated thanwith a wife.

SHALLOW

It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well saidindeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and everwere, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.

BARDOLPH

Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase callyou it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;but I will maintain the word with my sword to be asoldier-like word, and a word of exceeding goodcommand, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when aman is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;which is an excellent thing.

SHALLOW

It is very just.Enter FALSTAFF
Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your goodhand, give me your worship's good hand: by mytroth, you like well and bear your years very well:welcome, good Sir John.

FALSTAFF

I am glad to see you well, good Master RobertShallow: Master Surecard, as I think?

SHALLOW

No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.

FALSTAFF

Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be ofthe peace.

SILENCE

Your good-worship is welcome.

FALSTAFF

Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have youprovided me here half a dozen sufficient men?

SHALLOW

Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?

FALSTAFF

Let me see them, I beseech you.

SHALLOW

Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's theroll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear asI call; let them do so, let them do so. Let mesee; where is Mouldy?

MOULDY

Here, an't please you.

SHALLOW

What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;young, strong, and of good friends.

FALSTAFF

Is thy name Mouldy?

MOULDY

Yea, an't please you.

FALSTAFF

'Tis the more time thou wert used.

SHALLOW

Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things thatare mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,well said, Sir John, very well said.

FALSTAFF

Prick him.

MOULDY

I was pricked well enough before, an you could havelet me alone: my old dame will be undone now forone to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you neednot to have pricked me; there are other men fitterto go out than I.

FALSTAFF

Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it istime you were spent.

MOULDY

Spent!

SHALLOW

Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you whereyou are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:Simon Shadow!

FALSTAFF

Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's liketo be a cold soldier.

SHALLOW

Where's Shadow?

SHADOW

Here, sir.

FALSTAFF

Shadow, whose son art thou?

SHADOW

My mother's son, sir.

FALSTAFF

Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father'sshadow: so the son of the female is the shadow ofthe male: it is often so, indeed; but much of thefather's substance!

SHALLOW

Do you like him, Sir John?

FALSTAFF

Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we havea number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.

SHALLOW

Thomas Wart!

FALSTAFF

Where's he?

WART

Here, sir.

FALSTAFF

Is thy name Wart?

WART

Yea, sir.

FALSTAFF

Thou art a very ragged wart.

SHALLOW

Shall I prick him down, Sir John?

FALSTAFF

It were superfluous; for his apparel is built uponhis back and the whole frame stands upon pins:prick him no more.

SHALLOW

Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: Icommend you well. Francis Feeble!

FEEBLE

Here, sir.

FALSTAFF

What trade art thou, Feeble?

FEEBLE

A woman's tailor, sir.

SHALLOW

Shall I prick him, sir?

FALSTAFF

You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ldha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes inan enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

FEEBLE

I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.

FALSTAFF

Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as thewrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick thewoman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.

FEEBLE

I would Wart might have gone, sir.

FALSTAFF

I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightstmend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put himto a private soldier that is the leader of so manythousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.

FEEBLE

It shall suffice, sir.

FALSTAFF

I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?

SHALLOW

Peter Bullcalf o' the green!

FALSTAFF

Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.

BULLCALF

Here, sir.

FALSTAFF

'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalftill he roar again.

BULLCALF

O Lord! good my lord captain,--

FALSTAFF

What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?

BULLCALF

O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.

FALSTAFF

What disease hast thou?

BULLCALF

A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caughtwith ringing in the king's affairs upon hiscoronation-day, sir.

FALSTAFF

Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilthave away thy cold; and I will take such order thatmy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?

SHALLOW

Here is two more called than your number, you musthave but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go inwith me to dinner.

FALSTAFF

Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarrydinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all nightin the windmill in Saint George's field?

FALSTAFF

No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.

SHALLOW

Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?

FALSTAFF

She lives, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

She never could away with me.

FALSTAFF

Never, never; she would always say she could notabide Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. Shewas then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?

FALSTAFF

Old, old, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by oldNightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.

SILENCE

That's fifty-five year ago.

SHALLOW

Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that thatthis knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?

FALSTAFF

We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.Exeunt FALSTAFF and Justices


BULLCALF

Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crownsfor you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief behanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay withmy friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine ownpart, so much.

BARDOLPH

Go to; stand aside.

MOULDY

And, good master corporal captain, for my olddame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to doany thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.

BARDOLPH

Go to; stand aside.

FEEBLE

By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: weowe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man istoo good to serve's prince; and let it go which wayit will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.

BARDOLPH

Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.

FEEBLE

Faith, I'll bear no base mind.Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices


FALSTAFF

Come, sir, which men shall I have?

SHALLOW

Four of which you please.

BARDOLPH

Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to freeMouldy and Bullcalf.

FALSTAFF

Go to; well.

SHALLOW

Come, Sir John, which four will you have?

FALSTAFF

Do you choose for me.

SHALLOW

Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.

FALSTAFF

Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at hometill you are past service: and for your part,Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.

SHALLOW

Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they areyour likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.

FALSTAFF

Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose aman? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me thespirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what aragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you anddischarge you with the motion of a pewterer'shammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbetson the brewer's bucket. And this same half-facedfellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents nomark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aimlevel at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor runoff! O, give me the spare men, and spare me thegreat ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.

BARDOLPH

Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.

FALSTAFF

Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: goto: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always alittle, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's atester for thee.

SHALLOW

He is not his craft's master; he doth not do itright. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay atClement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur'sshow,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'would manage you his piece thus; and a' would aboutand about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; andaway again would a' go, and again would a' come: Ishall ne'er see such a fellow.

FALSTAFF

These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. Godkeep you, Master Silence: I will not use many wordswith you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thankyou: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, givethe soldiers coats.

SHALLOW

Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper youraffairs! God send us peace! At your return visitour house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;peradventure I will with ye to the court.

FALSTAFF

'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.

FALSTAFF

Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.Exeunt Justices
On, Bardolph; lead the men away.Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits,  & c
As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I dosee the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, howsubject we old men are to this vice of lying! Thissame starved justice hath done nothing but prate tome of the wildness of his youth, and the feats hehath done about Turnbull Street: and every thirdword a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk'stribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like aman made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forkedradish, with a head fantastically carved upon itwith a knife: a' was so forlorn, that hisdimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as amonkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' cameever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung thosetunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard thecarmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies orhis good-nights. And now is this Vice's daggerbecome a squire, and talks as familiarly of John aGaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; andI'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in theTilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowdingamong the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John aGaunt he beat his own name; for you might havethrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; thecase of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, acourt: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'llbe acquainted with him, if I return; and it shallgo hard but I will make him a philosopher's twostones to me: if the young dace be a bait for theold pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but Imay snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.Exit

Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forthTo know the numbers of our enemies.

HASTINGS

We have sent forth already.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

'Tis well done.My friends and brethren in these great affairs,I must acquaint you that I have receivedNew-dated letters from Northumberland;Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:Here doth he wish his person, with such powersAs might hold sortance with his quality,The which he could not levy; whereuponHe is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayersThat your attempts may overlive the hazardAnd fearful melting of their opposite.

Messenger

West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,In goodly form comes on the enemy;And, by the ground they hide, I judge their numberUpon or near the rate of thirty thousand.

I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.

WESTMORELAND

Health and fair greeting from our general,The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:What doth concern your coming?

WESTMORELAND

Then, my lord,Unto your grace do I in chief addressThe substance of my speech. If that rebellionCame like itself, in base and abject routs,Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,And countenanced by boys and beggary,I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,In his true, native and most proper shape,You, reverend father, and these noble lordsHad not been here, to dress the ugly formOf base and bloody insurrectionWith your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,Whose white investments figure innocence,The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,Wherefore do you so ill translate ourselfOut of the speech of peace that bears such grace,Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,Your pens to lances and your tongue divineTo a trumpet and a point of war?

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,And with our surfeiting and wanton hoursHave brought ourselves into a burning fever,And we must bleed for it; of which diseaseOur late king, Richard, being infected, died.But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,I take not on me here as a physician,Nor do I as an enemy to peaceTroop in the throngs of military men;But rather show awhile like fearful war,To diet rank minds sick of happinessAnd purge the obstructions which begin to stopOur very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.I have in equal balance justly weigh'dWhat wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,And find our griefs heavier than our offences.We see which way the stream of time doth run,And are enforced from our most quiet thereBy the rough torrent of occasion;And have the summary of all our griefs,When time shall serve, to show in articles;Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,And might by no suit gain our audience:When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,We are denied access unto his personEven by those men that most have done us wrong.The dangers of the days but newly gone,Whose memory is written on the earthWith yet appearing blood, and the examplesOf every minute's instance, present now,Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,Not to break peace or any branch of it,But to establish here a peace indeed,Concurring both in name and quality.

WESTMORELAND

When ever yet was your appeal denied?Wherein have you been galled by the king?What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,That you should seal this lawless bloody bookOf forged rebellion with a seal divineAnd consecrate commotion's bitter edge?

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

My brother general, the commonwealth,To brother born an household cruelty,I make my quarrel in particular.

WESTMORELAND

There is no need of any such redress;Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

MOWBRAY

Why not to him in part, and to us allThat feel the bruises of the days before,And suffer the condition of these timesTo lay a heavy and unequal handUpon our honours?

WESTMORELAND

                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,Construe the times to their necessities,And you shall say indeed, it is the time,And not the king, that doth you injuries.Yet for your part, it not appears to meEither from the king or in the present timeThat you should have an inch of any groundTo build a grief on: were you not restoredTo all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,Your noble and right well remember'd father's?

MOWBRAY

What thing, in honour, had my father lost,That need to be revived and breathed in me?The king that loved him, as the state stood then,Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,Being mounted and both roused in their seats,Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steelAnd the loud trumpet blowing them together,Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'dMy father from the breast of Bolingbroke,O when the king did throw his warder down,His own life hung upon the staff he threw;Then threw he down himself and all their livesThat by indictment and by dint of swordHave since miscarried under Bolingbroke.

WESTMORELAND

You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.The Earl of Hereford was reputed thenIn England the most valiant gentlemen:Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?But if your father had been victor there,He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:For all the country in a general voiceCried hate upon him; and all their prayers and loveWere set on Hereford, whom they doted onAnd bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.But this is mere digression from my purpose.Here come I from our princely generalTo know your griefs; to tell you from his graceThat he will give you audience; and whereinIt shall appear that your demands are just,You shall enjoy them, every thing set offThat might so much as think you enemies.

MOWBRAY

But he hath forced us to compel this offer;And it proceeds from policy, not love.

WESTMORELAND

Mowbray, you overween to take it so;This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:For, lo! within a ken our army lies,Upon mine honour, all too confidentTo give admittance to a thought of fear.Our battle is more full of names than yours,Our men more perfect in the use of arms,Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;Then reason will our heart should be as goodSay you not then our offer is compell'd.

MOWBRAY

Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.

WESTMORELAND

That argues but the shame of your offence:A rotten case abides no handling.

HASTINGS

Hath the Prince John a full commission,In very ample virtue of his father,To hear and absolutely to determineOf what conditions we shall stand upon?

WESTMORELAND

That is intended in the general's name:I muse you make so slight a question.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,For this contains our general grievances:Each several article herein redress'd,All members of our cause, both here and hence,That are insinew'd to this action,Acquitted by a true substantial formAnd present execution of our willsTo us and to our purposes confined,We come within our awful banks againAnd knit our powers to the arm of peace.

WESTMORELAND

This will I show the general. Please you, lords,In sight of both our battles we may meet;And either end in peace, which God so frame!Or to the place of difference call the swordsWhich must decide it.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

My lord, we will do so.Exit WESTMORELAND


MOWBRAY

There is a thing within my bosom tells meThat no conditions of our peace can stand.

HASTINGS

Fear you not that: if we can make our peaceUpon such large terms and so absoluteAs our conditions shall consist upon,Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.

MOWBRAY

Yea, but our valuation shall be suchThat every slight and false-derived cause,Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reasonShall to the king taste of this action;That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,We shall be winnow'd with so rough a windThat even our corn shall seem as light as chaffAnd good from bad find no partition.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is wearyOf dainty and such picking grievances:For he hath found to end one doubt by deathRevives two greater in the heirs of life,And therefore will he wipe his tables cleanAnd keep no tell-tale to his memoryThat may repeat and history his lossTo new remembrance; for full well he knowsHe cannot so precisely weed this landAs his misdoubts present occasion:His foes are so enrooted with his friendsThat, plucking to unfix an enemy,He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:So that this land, like an offensive wifeThat hath enraged him on to offer strokes,As he is striking, holds his infant upAnd hangs resolved correction in the armThat was uprear'd to execution.

HASTINGS

Besides, the king hath wasted all his rodsOn late offenders, that he now doth lackThe very instruments of chastisement:So that his power, like to a fangless lion,May offer, but not hold.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

'Tis very true:And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,If we do now make our atonement well,Our peace will, like a broken limb united,Grow stronger for the breaking.

MOWBRAY

Be it so.Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.Re-enter WESTMORELAND


WESTMORELAND

The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordshipTo meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.

MOWBRAY

Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the forest.

Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards  the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from  the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them


LANCASTER

You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.My Lord of York, it better show'd with youWhen that your flock, assembled by the bell,Encircled you to hear with reverenceYour exposition on the holy textThan now to see you here an iron man,Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,Turning the word to sword and life to death.That man that sits within a monarch's heart,And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,Would he abuse the countenance of the king,Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroochIn shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,It is even so. Who hath not heard it spokenHow deep you were within the books of God?To us the speaker in his parliament;To us the imagined voice of God himself;The very opener and intelligencerBetween the grace, the sanctities of heavenAnd our dull workings. O, who shall believeBut you misuse the reverence of your place,Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,As a false favourite doth his prince's name,In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,Under the counterfeited zeal of God,The subjects of his substitute, my father,And both against the peace of heaven and himHave here up-swarm'd them.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Good my Lord of Lancaster,I am not here against your father's peace;But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,To hold our safety up. I sent your graceThe parcels and particulars of our grief,The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepWith grant of our most just and right desires,And true obedience, of this madness cured,Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

MOWBRAY

If not, we ready are to try our fortunesTo the last man.

HASTINGS

                  And though we here fall down,We have supplies to second our attempt:If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;And so success of mischief shall be bornAnd heir from heir shall hold this quarrel upWhiles England shall have generation.

LANCASTER

You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,To sound the bottom of the after-times.

WESTMORELAND

Pleaseth your grace to answer them directlyHow far forth you do like their articles.

LANCASTER

I like them all, and do allow them well,And swear here, by the honour of my blood,My father's purposes have been mistook,And some about him have too lavishlyWrested his meaning and authority.My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,Discharge your powers unto their several counties,As we will ours: and here between the armiesLet's drink together friendly and embrace,That all their eyes may bear those tokens homeOf our restored love and amity.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

I take your princely word for these redresses.

LANCASTER

I give it you, and will maintain my word:And thereupon I drink unto your grace.

HASTINGS

Go, captain, and deliver to the armyThis news of peace: let them have pay, and part:I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.Exit Officer


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.

WESTMORELAND

I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what painsI have bestow'd to breed this present peace,You would drink freely: but my love to yeShall show itself more openly hereafter.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

I do not doubt you.

WESTMORELAND

I am glad of it.Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

MOWBRAY

You wish me health in very happy season;For I am, on the sudden, something ill.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Against ill chances men are ever merry;But heaviness foreruns the good event.

WESTMORELAND

Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrowServes to say thus, 'some good thing comesto-morrow.'

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.

MOWBRAY

So much the worse, if your own rule be true.Shouts within


LANCASTER

The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!

MOWBRAY

This had been cheerful after victory.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

A peace is of the nature of a conquest;For then both parties nobly are subdued,And neither party loser.

LANCASTER

Go, my lord,And let our army be discharged too.Exit WESTMORELAND
And, good my lord, so please you, let our trainsMarch, by us, that we may peruse the menWe should have coped withal.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Go, good Lord Hastings,And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.Exit HASTINGS


LANCASTER

I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.Re-enter WESTMORELAND
Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?

WESTMORELAND

The leaders, having charge from you to stand,Will not go off until they hear you speak.

LANCASTER

They know their duties.Re-enter HASTINGS


HASTINGS

My lord, our army is dispersed already;Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their coursesEast, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.

WESTMORELAND

Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the whichI do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,Of capitol treason I attach you both.

MOWBRAY

Is this proceeding just and honourable?

WESTMORELAND

Is your assembly so?

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Will you thus break your faith?

LANCASTER

I pawn'd thee none:I promised you redress of these same grievancesWhereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,I will perform with a most Christian care.But for you, rebels, look to taste the dueMeet for rebellion and such acts as yours.Most shallowly did you these arms commence,Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.Some guard these traitors to the block of death,Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the forest.

Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting


FALSTAFF

What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,and of what place, I pray?

COLEVILE

I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.

FALSTAFF

Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is yourdegree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall bestill your name, a traitor your degree, and thedungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shallyou be still Colevile of the dale.

COLEVILE

Are not you Sir John Falstaff?

FALSTAFF

As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do yeyield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I dosweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and theyweep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear andtrembling, and do observance to my mercy.

COLEVILE

I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in thatthought yield me.

FALSTAFF

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly ofmine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any otherword but my name. An I had but a belly of anyindifference, I were simply the most active fellowin Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.Here comes our general.Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others


LANCASTER

The heat is past; follow no further now:Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.Exit WESTMORELAND
Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?When every thing is ended, then you come:These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,One time or other break some gallows' back.

FALSTAFF

I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: Inever knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the rewardof valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or abullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, theexpedition of thought? I have speeded hither withthe very extremest inch of possibility; I havefoundered nine score and odd posts: and here,travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure andimmaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of thedale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that Imay justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,'I came, saw, and overcame.'

LANCASTER

It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.

FALSTAFF

I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: andI beseech your grace, let it be booked with therest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I willhave it in a particular ballad else, with mine ownpicture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:to the which course if I be enforced, if you do notall show like gilt twopences to me, and I in theclear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the fullmoon doth the cinders of the element, which showlike pins' heads to her, believe not the word ofthe noble: therefore let me have right, and letdesert mount.

LANCASTER

Thine's too heavy to mount.

FALSTAFF

Let it shine, then.

LANCASTER

Thine's too thick to shine.

FALSTAFF

Let it do something, my good lord, that may do megood, and call it what you will.

LANCASTER

Is thy name Colevile?

COLEVILE

It is, my lord.

LANCASTER

A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.

FALSTAFF

And a famous true subject took him.

COLEVILE

I am, my lord, but as my betters areThat led me hither: had they been ruled by me,You should have won them dearer than you have.

FALSTAFF

I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, likea kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and Ithank thee for thee.Re-enter WESTMORELAND


LANCASTER

Now, have you left pursuit?

WESTMORELAND

Retreat is made and execution stay'd.

LANCASTER

Send Colevile with his confederatesTo York, to present execution:Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE
And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:I hear the king my father is sore sick:Our news shall go before us to his majesty,Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,And we with sober speed will follow you.

FALSTAFF

My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to goThrough Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.

LANCASTER

Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,Shall better speak of you than you deserve.Exeunt all but Falstaff


FALSTAFF

I would you had but the wit: 'twere better thanyour dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot makehim laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.There's never none of these demure boys come to anyproof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,and making many fish-meals, that they fall into akind of male green-sickness; and then when theymarry, they get wenches: they are generally foolsand cowards; which some of us should be too, but forinflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-foldoperation in it. It ascends me into the brain;dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdyvapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery anddelectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to thevoice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomesexcellent wit. The second property of yourexcellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;which, before cold and settled, left the liverwhite and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimityand cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makesit course from the inwards to the parts extreme:it illumineth the face, which as a beacon giveswarning to all the rest of this little kingdom,man, to arm; and then the vital commoners andinland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,the heart, who, great and puffed up with thisretinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valourcomes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon isnothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; andlearning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, tillsack commences it and sets it in act and use.Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; forthe cold blood he did naturally inherit of hisfather, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,manured, husbanded and tilled with excellentendeavour of drinking good and good store of fertilesherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. IfI had a thousand sons, the first humane principle Iwould teach them should be, to forswear thinpotations and to addict themselves to sack.Enter BARDOLPH
How now Bardolph?

BARDOLPH

The army is discharged all and gone.

FALSTAFF

Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; andthere will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:I have him already tempering between my finger andmy thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.

Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others


KING HENRY IV

Now, lords, if God doth give successful endTo this debate that bleedeth at our doors,We will our youth lead on to higher fieldsAnd draw no swords but what are sanctified.Our navy is address'd, our power collected,Our substitutes in absence well invested,And every thing lies level to our wish:Only, we want a little personal strength;And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,Come underneath the yoke of government.

WARWICK

Both which we doubt not but your majestyShall soon enjoy.

KING HENRY IV

                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,Where is the prince your brother?

GLOUCESTER

I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.

KING HENRY IV

And how accompanied?

GLOUCESTER

I do not know, my lord.

KING HENRY IV

Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?

GLOUCESTER

No, my good lord; he is in presence here.

CLARENCE

What would my lord and father?

KING HENRY IV

Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;Thou hast a better place in his affectionThan all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,And noble offices thou mayst effectOf mediation, after I am dead,Between his greatness and thy other brethren:Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,Nor lose the good advantage of his graceBy seeming cold or careless of his will;For he is gracious, if he be observed:He hath a tear for pity and a handOpen as day for melting charity:Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,As humorous as winter and as suddenAs flaws congealed in the spring of day.His temper, therefore, must be well observed:Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;But, being moody, give him line and scope,Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,That the united vessel of their blood,Mingled with venom of suggestion--As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--Shall never leak, though it do work as strongAs aconitum or rash gunpowder.

CLARENCE

I shall observe him with all care and love.

KING HENRY IV

Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?

CLARENCE

He is not there to-day; he dines in London.

KING HENRY IV

And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?

CLARENCE

With Poins, and other his continual followers.

KING HENRY IV

Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;And he, the noble image of my youth,Is overspread with them: therefore my griefStretches itself beyond the hour of death:The blood weeps from my heart when I do shapeIn forms imaginary the unguided daysAnd rotten times that you shall look uponWhen I am sleeping with my ancestors.For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,When means and lavish manners meet together,O, with what wings shall his affections flyTowards fronting peril and opposed decay!

WARWICK

My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:The prince but studies his companionsLike a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,'Tis needful that the most immodest wordBe look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,Your highness knows, comes to no further useBut to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,The prince will in the perfectness of timeCast off his followers; and their memoryShall as a pattern or a measure live,By which his grace must mete the lives of others,Turning past evils to advantages.

KING HENRY IV

'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her combIn the dead carrion.Enter WESTMORELAND
Who's here? Westmoreland?

WESTMORELAND

Health to my sovereign, and new happinessAdded to that that I am to deliver!Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and allAre brought to the correction of your law;There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'dBut peace puts forth her olive every where.The manner how this action hath been borneHere at more leisure may your highness read,With every course in his particular.

KING HENRY IV

O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,Which ever in the haunch of winter singsThe lifting up of day.Enter HARCOURT
Look, here's more news.

HARCOURT

From enemies heaven keep your majesty;And, when they stand against you, may they fallAs those that I am come to tell you of!The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,With a great power of English and of ScotsAre by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:The manner and true order of the fightThis packet, please it you, contains at large.

KING HENRY IV

And wherefore should these good news make me sick?Will fortune never come with both hands full,But write her fair words still in foulest letters?She either gives a stomach and no food;Such are the poor, in health; or else a feastAnd takes away the stomach; such are the rich,That have abundance and enjoy it not.I should rejoice now at this happy news;And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:O me! come near me; now I am much ill.

GLOUCESTER

Comfort, your majesty!

CLARENCE

O my royal father!

WESTMORELAND

My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.

WARWICK

Be patient, princes; you do know, these fitsAre with his highness very ordinary.Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.

CLARENCE

No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:The incessant care and labour of his mindHath wrought the mure that should confine it inSo thin that life looks through and will break out.

GLOUCESTER

The people fear me; for they do observeUnfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:The seasons change their manners, as the yearHad found some months asleep and leap'd them over.

CLARENCE

The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,Say it did so a little time beforeThat our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.

WARWICK

Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.

GLOUCESTER

This apoplexy will certain be his end.

KING HENRY IV

I pray you, take me up, and bear me henceInto some other chamber: softly, pray.
SCENE V. Another chamber.

KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance


KING HENRY IV

Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;Unless some dull and favourable handWill whisper music to my weary spirit.

WARWICK

Call for the music in the other room.

KING HENRY IV

Set me the crown upon my pillow here.

CLARENCE

His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

WARWICK

Less noise, less noise!Enter PRINCE HENRY


PRINCE HENRY

Who saw the Duke of Clarence?

CLARENCE

I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

PRINCE HENRY

How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!How doth the king?

GLOUCESTER

Exceeding ill.

PRINCE HENRY

                  Heard he the good news yet?Tell it him.

GLOUCESTER

He alter'd much upon the hearing it.

PRINCE HENRY

If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.

WARWICK

Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,speak low;The king your father is disposed to sleep.

CLARENCE

Let us withdraw into the other room.

WARWICK

Will't please your grace to go along with us?

PRINCE HENRY

No; I will sit and watch here by the king.Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,Being so troublesome a bedfellow?O polish'd perturbation! golden care!That keep'st the ports of slumber open wideTo many a watchful night! sleep with it now!Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweetAs he whose brow with homely biggen boundSnores out the watch of night. O majesty!When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sitLike a rich armour worn in heat of day,That scalds with safety. By his gates of breathThere lies a downy feather which stirs not:Did he suspire, that light and weightless downPerforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleepThat from this golden rigol hath divorcedSo many English kings. Thy due from meIs tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:My due from thee is this imperial crown,Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strengthInto one giant arm, it shall not forceThis lineal honour from me: this from theeWill I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.Exit


KING HENRY IV

Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest


CLARENCE

Doth the king call?

WARWICK

What would your majesty? How fares your grace?

KING HENRY IV

Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

CLARENCE

We left the prince my brother here, my liege,Who undertook to sit and watch by you.

KING HENRY IV

The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:He is not here.

WARWICK

This door is open; he is gone this way.

GLOUCESTER

He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.

KING HENRY IV

Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?

WARWICK

When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.

KING HENRY IV

The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.Is he so hasty that he doth supposeMy sleep my death?Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.Exit WARWICK
This part of his conjoins with my disease,And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!How quickly nature falls into revoltWhen gold becomes her object!For this the foolish over-careful fathersHave broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,Their bones with industry;For this they have engrossed and piled upThe canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;For this they have been thoughtful to investTheir sons with arts and martial exercises:When, like the bee, culling from every flowerThe virtuous sweets,Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,Are murdered for our pains. This bitter tasteYield his engrossments to the ending father.Re-enter WARWICK
Now, where is he that will not stay so longTill his friend sickness hath determined me?

WARWICK

My lord, I found the prince in the next room,Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,With such a deep demeanor in great sorrowThat tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knifeWith gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.

KING HENRY IV

But wherefore did he take away the crown?Re-enter PRINCE HENRY
Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.Exeunt WARWICK and the rest


PRINCE HENRY

I never thought to hear you speak again.

KING HENRY IV

Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chairThat thou wilt needs invest thee with my honoursBefore thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignityIs held from falling with so weak a windThat it will quickly drop: my day is dim.Thou hast stolen that which after some few hoursWere thine without offence; and at my deathThou hast seal'd up my expectation:Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,And thou wilt have me die assured of it.Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,To stab at half an hour of my life.What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,And bid the merry bells ring to thine earThat thou art crowned, not that I am dead.Let all the tears that should bedew my hearseBe drops of balm to sanctify thy head:Only compound me with forgotten dustGive that which gave thee life unto the worms.Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;For now a time is come to mock at form:Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!And to the English court assemble now,From every region, apes of idleness!Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,Revel the night, rob, murder, and commitThe oldest sins the newest kind of ways?Be happy, he will trouble you no more;England shall double gild his treble guilt,England shall give him office, honour, might;For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucksThe muzzle of restraint, and the wild dogShall flesh his tooth on every innocent.O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!When that my care could not withhold thy riots,What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!

PRINCE HENRY

O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,The moist impediments unto my speech,I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebukeEre you with grief had spoke and I had heardThe course of it so far. There is your crown;And He that wears the crown immortallyLong guard it yours! If I affect it moreThan as your honour and as your renown,Let me no more from this obedience rise,Which my most inward true and duteous spiritTeacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.God witness with me, when I here came in,And found no course of breath within your majesty,How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,O, let me in my present wildness dieAnd never live to show the incredulous worldThe noble change that I have purposed!Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,I spake unto this crown as having sense,And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee dependingHath fed upon the body of my father;Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,Preserving life in medicine potable;But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,Accusing it, I put it on my head,To try with it, as with an enemyThat had before my face murder'd my father,The quarrel of a true inheritor.But if it did infect my blood with joy,Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;If any rebel or vain spirit of mineDid with the least affection of a welcomeGive entertainment to the might of it,Let God for ever keep it from my headAnd make me as the poorest vassal isThat doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

KING HENRY IV

O my son,God put it in thy mind to take it hence,That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;And hear, I think, the very latest counselThat ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,By what by-paths and indirect crook'd waysI met this crown; and I myself know wellHow troublesome it sat upon my head.To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,Better opinion, better confirmation;For all the soil of the achievement goesWith me into the earth. It seem'd in meBut as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,And I had many living to upbraidMy gain of it by their assistances;Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fearsThou see'st with peril I have answered;For all my reign hath been but as a sceneActing that argument: and now my deathChanges the mode; for what in me was purchased,Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;So thou the garland wear'st successively.Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;By whose fell working I was first advancedAnd by whose power I well might lodge a fearTo be again displaced: which to avoid,I cut them off; and had a purpose nowTo lead out many to the Holy Land,Lest rest and lying still might make them lookToo near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,Be it thy course to busy giddy mindsWith foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,May waste the memory of the former days.More would I, but my lungs are wasted soThat strength of speech is utterly denied me.How I came by the crown, O God forgive;And grant it may with thee in true peace live!

PRINCE HENRY

My gracious liege,You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;Then plain and right must my possession be:Which I with more than with a common pain'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.Enter Lord John of LANCASTER


KING HENRY IV

Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.

LANCASTER

Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!

KING HENRY IV

Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;But health, alack, with youthful wings is flownFrom this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sightMy worldly business makes a period.Where is my Lord of Warwick?

PRINCE HENRY

My Lord of Warwick!Enter WARWICK, and others


KING HENRY IV

Doth any name particular belongUnto the lodging where I first did swoon?

WARWICK

'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.

KING HENRY IV

Laud be to God! even there my life must end.It hath been prophesied to me many years,I should not die but in Jerusalem;Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house.

Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page


SHALLOW

By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.What, Davy, I say!

FALSTAFF

You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.

SHALLOW

I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuseshall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!Enter DAVY


DAVY

Here, sir.

SHALLOW

Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let mesee, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.

DAVY

Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?

SHALLOW

With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: arethere no young pigeons?

DAVY

Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeingand plough-irons.

SHALLOW

Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.

DAVY

Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need behad: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William'swages, about the sack he lost the other day atHinckley fair?

SHALLOW

A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a coupleof short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and anypretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.

DAVY

Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?

SHALLOW

Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' thecourt is better than a penny in purse. Use his menwell, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.

DAVY

No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for theyhave marvellous foul linen.

SHALLOW

Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.

DAVY

I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor ofWoncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.

SHALLOW

There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.

DAVY

I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; butyet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have somecountenance at his friend's request. An honestman, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knaveis not. I have served your worship truly, sir,this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice ina quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, Ihave but a very little credit with your worship. Theknave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, Ibeseech your worship, let him be countenanced.

SHALLOW

Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.Exit DAVY
Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, offwith your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.

BARDOLPH

I am glad to see your worship.

SHALLOW

I thank thee with all my heart, kindMaster Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.To the Page
Come, Sir John.

FALSTAFF

I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.Exit SHALLOW
Bardolph, look to our horses.Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page
If I were sawed into quantities, I should make fourdozen of such bearded hermits' staves as MasterShallow. It is a wonderful thing to see thesemblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:they, by observing of him, do bear themselves likefoolish justices; he, by conversing with them, isturned into a justice-like serving-man: theirspirits are so married in conjunction with theparticipation of society that they flock together inconsent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suitto Master Shallow, I would humour his men with theimputation of being near their master: if to hismen, I would curry with Master Shallow that no mancould better command his servants. It is certainthat either wise bearing or ignorant carriage iscaught, as men take diseases, one of another:therefore let men take heed of their company. Iwill devise matter enough out of this Shallow tokeep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearingout of six fashions, which is four terms, or twoactions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jestwith a sad brow will do with a fellow that neverhad the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see himlaugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!

SHALLOW

[Within]  Sir John!

FALSTAFF

I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.Exit

SCENE II. Westminster. The palace.

Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting


WARWICK

How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?Lord Chief-Justice	How doth the king?

WARWICK

Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.Lord Chief-Justice	I hope, not dead.

WARWICK

He's walk'd the way of nature;And to our purposes he lives no more.Lord Chief-Justice	I would his majesty had call'd me with him:The service that I truly did his lifeHath left me open to all injuries.

WARWICK

Indeed I think the young king loves you not.Lord Chief-Justice	I know he doth not, and do arm myselfTo welcome the condition of the time,Which cannot look more hideously upon meThan I have drawn it in my fantasy.Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others


WARWICK

Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:O that the living Harry had the temperOf him, the worst of these three gentlemen!How many nobles then should hold their placesThat must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!Lord Chief-Justice	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!

LANCASTER

Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.

GLOUCESTER

CLARENCE

Good morrow, cousin.

LANCASTER

We meet like men that had forgot to speak.

WARWICK

We do remember; but our argumentIs all too heavy to admit much talk.

LANCASTER

Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.Lord Chief-Justice	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!

GLOUCESTER

O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;And I dare swear you borrow not that faceOf seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.

LANCASTER

Though no man be assured what grace to find,You stand in coldest expectation:I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.

CLARENCE

Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;Which swims against your stream of quality.Lord Chief-Justice	Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:And never shall you see that I will begA ragged and forestall'd remission.If truth and upright innocency fail me,I'll to the king my master that is dead,And tell him who hath sent me after him.

WARWICK

Here comes the prince.Enter KING HENRY V, attended
Lord Chief-Justice	Good morrow; and God save your majesty!

KING HENRY V

This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,Sits not so easy on me as you think.Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:This is the English, not the Turkish court;Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:Sorrow so royally in you appearsThat I will deeply put the fashion onAnd wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;But entertain no more of it, good brothers,Than a joint burden laid upon us all.For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,I'll be your father and your brother too;Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;But Harry lives, that shall convert those tearsBy number into hours of happiness.

Princes

We hope no other from your majesty.

KING HENRY V

You all look strangely on me: and you most;You are, I think, assured I love you not.Lord Chief-Justice	I am assured, if I be measured rightly,Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

KING HENRY V

No!How might a prince of my great hopes forgetSo great indignities you laid upon me?What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prisonThe immediate heir of England! Was this easy?May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?Lord Chief-Justice	I then did use the person of your father;The image of his power lay then in me:And, in the administration of his law,Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,Your highness pleased to forget my place,The majesty and power of law and justice,The image of the king whom I presented,And struck me in my very seat of judgment;Whereon, as an offender to your father,I gave bold way to my authorityAnd did commit you. If the deed were ill,Be you contented, wearing now the garland,To have a son set your decrees at nought,To pluck down justice from your awful bench,To trip the course of law and blunt the swordThat guards the peace and safety of your person;Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal imageAnd mock your workings in a second body.Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;Be now the father and propose a son,Hear your own dignity so much profaned,See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;And then imagine me taking your partAnd in your power soft silencing your son:After this cold considerance, sentence me;And, as you are a king, speak in your stateWhat I have done that misbecame my place,My person, or my liege's sovereignty.

KING HENRY V

You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:And I do wish your honours may increase,Till you do live to see a son of mineOffend you and obey you, as I did.So shall I live to speak my father's words:'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,That dares do justice on my proper son;And not less happy, having such a son,That would deliver up his greatness soInto the hands of justice.' You did commit me:For which, I do commit into your handThe unstained sword that you have used to bear;With this remembrance, that you use the sameWith the like bold, just and impartial spiritAs you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.You shall be as a father to my youth:My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,And I will stoop and humble my intentsTo your well-practised wise directions.And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;My father is gone wild into his grave,For in his tomb lie my affections;And with his spirit sadly I survive,To mock the expectation of the world,To frustrate prophecies and to raze outRotten opinion, who hath writ me downAfter my seeming. The tide of blood in meHath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,Where it shall mingle with the state of floodsAnd flow henceforth in formal majesty.Now call we our high court of parliament:And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,That the great body of our state may goIn equal rank with the best govern'd nation;That war, or peace, or both at once, may beAs things acquainted and familiar to us;In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.Our coronation done, we will accite,As I before remember'd, all our state:And, God consigning to my good intents,No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,God shorten Harry's happy life one day!Exeunt

SCENE III. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S orchard.

Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, SILENCE, DAVY, BARDOLPH, and the Page


SHALLOW

Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing,with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,cousin Silence: and then to bed.

FALSTAFF

'Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.

SHALLOW

Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all,Sir John: marry, good air. Spread, Davy; spread,Davy; well said, Davy.

This Davy serves you for good uses; he is yourserving-man and your husband.

SHALLOW

For women are shrews, both short and tall:'Tis merry in hall when beards wag all,And welcome merry Shrove-tide.Be merry, be merry.

Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.Re-enter DAVY


DAVY

There's a dish of leather-coats for you.To BARDOLPH


SHALLOW

Well said, Master Silence.

An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' the night.

FALSTAFF

Health and long life to you, Master Silence.

Fill the cup, and let it come;Singing
I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.

SHALLOW

Honest Bardolph, welcome: if thou wantest anything, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart.Welcome, my little tiny thief.To the Page
And welcome indeed too. I'll drink to MasterBardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London.

DAVY

I hove to see London once ere I die.

BARDOLPH

An I might see you there, Davy,--

SHALLOW

By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha!Will you not, Master Bardolph?

BARDOLPH

Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.

SHALLOW

By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave willstick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will notout; he is true bred.

BARDOLPH

And I'll stick by him, sir.

From the court! let him come in.Enter PISTOL
How now, Pistol!

PISTOL

Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweetknight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.

SILENCE

By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.

PISTOL

Puff!Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,And tidings do I bring and lucky joysAnd golden times and happy news of price.

FALSTAFF

I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.

PISTOL

FALSTAFF

O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.

SILENCE

And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.Singing


PISTOL

Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?And shall good news be baffled?Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.

SILENCE

Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.

PISTOL

Why then, lament therefore.

SHALLOW

Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with newsfrom the court, I take it there's but two ways,either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,sir, under the king, in some authority.

Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.

SHALLOW

Under King Harry.

PISTOL

As nail in door: the things I speak are just.

FALSTAFF

Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master RobertShallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.

Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devisesomething to do thyself good. Boot, boot, MasterShallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Letus take any man's horses; the laws of England are atmy commandment. Blessed are they that have been myfriends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!

DOLL TEARSHEET

Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tellthee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, anthe child I now go with do miscarry, thou wertbetter thou hadst struck thy mother, thoupaper-faced villain.

O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would makethis a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God thefruit of her womb miscarry!

First Beadle

If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both gowith me; for the man is dead that you and Pistolbeat amongst you.

DOLL TEARSHEET

I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, Iwill have you as soundly swinged for this,--youblue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.

PISTOL

God bless thy lungs, good knight.

FALSTAFF

Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had hadtime to have made new liveries, I would havebestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: thisdoth infer the zeal I had to see him.

SHALLOW

It doth so.

FALSTAFF

It shows my earnestness of affection,--

SHALLOW

It doth so.

FALSTAFF

My devotion,--

SHALLOW

It doth, it doth, it doth.

FALSTAFF

As it were, to ride day and night; and not todeliberate, not to remember, not to have patienceto shift me,--

SHALLOW

It is best, certain.

FALSTAFF

But to stand stained with travel, and sweating withdesire to see him; thinking of nothing else,putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if therewere nothing else to be done but to see him.

PISTOL

'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:''tis all in every part.

SHALLOW

'Tis so, indeed.

PISTOL

My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,And make thee rage.Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,Is in base durance and contagious prison;Haled thitherBy most mechanical and dirty hand:Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fellAlecto's snake,For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.

FALSTAFF

My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!

KING HENRY IV

I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gapeFor thee thrice wider than for other men.Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:Presume not that I am the thing I was;For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,That I have turn'd away my former self;So will I those that kept me company.When thou dost hear I am as I have been,Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,The tutor and the feeder of my riots:Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,As I have done the rest of my misleaders,Not to come near our person by ten mile.For competence of life I will allow you,That lack of means enforce you not to evil:And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,We will, according to your strengths and qualities,Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.Exeunt KING HENRY V,  & c


FALSTAFF

Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.

SHALLOW

Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let mehave home with me.

FALSTAFF

That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not yougrieve at this; I shall be sent for in private tohim: look you, he must seem thus to the world:fear not your advancements; I will be the man yetthat shall make you great.

SHALLOW

I cannot well perceive how, unless you should giveme your doublet and stuff me out with straw. Ibeseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundredof my thousand.

FALSTAFF

Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that youheard was but a colour.

SHALLOW

A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.

FALSTAFF

Fear no colours: go  with me to dinner: come,Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sentfor soon at night.Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers with them
Lord Chief-Justice	Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:Take all his company along with him.

FALSTAFF

My lord, my lord,--Lord Chief-Justice	I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.Take them away.

PISTOL

Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice


LANCASTER

I like this fair proceeding of the king's:He hath intent his wonted followersShall all be very well provided for;But all are banish'd till their conversationsAppear more wise and modest to the world.Lord Chief-Justice	And so they are.

LANCASTER

The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.Lord Chief-Justice	He hath.

LANCASTER

I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,We bear our civil swords and native fireAs far as France: I beard a bird so sing,Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.Come, will you hence?Exeunt
EPILOGUESpoken by a Dancer
First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you lookfor a good speech now, you undo me: for what I haveto say is of mine own making; and what indeed Ishould say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be itknown to you, as it is very well, I was lately herein the end of a displeasing play, to pray yourpatience for it and to promise you a better. Imeant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like anill venture it come unluckily home, I break, andyou, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised youI would be and here I commit my body to yourmercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, willyou command me to use my legs? and yet that were butlight payment, to dance out of your debt. But agood conscience will make any possible satisfaction,and so would I. All the gentlewomen here haveforgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then thegentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, whichwas never seen before in such an assembly.One word more, I beseech you. If you be not toomuch cloyed with fat meat, our humble author willcontinue the story, with Sir John in it, and makeyou merry with fair Katharine of France: where, forany thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,unless already a' be killed with your hardopinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this isnot the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs aretoo, I will bid you good night: and so kneel downbefore you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
