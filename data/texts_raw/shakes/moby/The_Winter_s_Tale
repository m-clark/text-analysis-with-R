SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.

Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS


ARCHIDAMUS

If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, onthe like occasion whereon my services are now onfoot, you shall see, as I have said, greatdifference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO

I think, this coming summer, the King of Siciliameans to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS

Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will bejustified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO

Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS

Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I knownot what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuseus.

CAMILLO

You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS

Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs meand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO

Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.They were trained together in their childhoods; andthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,which cannot choose but branch now. Since theirmore mature dignities and royal necessities madeseparation of their society, their encounters,though not personal, have been royally attorneyedwith interchange of gifts, letters, lovingembassies; that they have seemed to be together,though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, andembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposedwinds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS

I think there is not in the world either malice ormatter to alter it. You have an unspeakablecomfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is agentleman of the greatest promise that ever cameinto my note.

CAMILLO

I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: itis a gallant child; one that indeed physics thesubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went oncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life tosee him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS

Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO

Yes; if there were no other excuse why they shoulddesire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS

If the king had no son, they would desire to liveon crutches till he had one.Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the same.

Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants


POLIXENES

Nine changes of the watery star hath beenThe shepherd's note since we have left our throneWithout a burthen: time as long againWould be find up, my brother, with our thanks;And yet we should, for perpetuity,Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,Yet standing in rich place, I multiplyWith one 'We thank you' many thousands moeThat go before it.

LEONTES

                  Stay your thanks a while;And pay them when you part.

POLIXENES

Sir, that's to-morrow.I am question'd by my fears, of what may chanceOr breed upon our absence; that may blowNo sneaping winds at home, to make us say'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'dTo tire your royalty.

LEONTES

We are tougher, brother,Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES

No longer stay.

LEONTES

One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES

Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES

We'll part the time between's then; and in thatI'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES

Press me not, beseech you, so.There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,Were there necessity in your request, although'Twere needful I denied it. My affairsDo even drag me homeward: which to hinderWere in your love a whip to me; my stayTo you a charge and trouble: to save both,Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES

Tongue-tied, our queen?speak you.

HERMIONE

I had thought, sir, to have held my peace untilYou have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sureAll in Bohemia's well; this satisfactionThe by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES

Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE

To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:But let him say so then, and let him go;But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.Yet of your royal presence I'll adventureThe borrow of a week. When at BohemiaYou take my lord, I'll give him my commissionTo let him there a month behind the gestPrefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,I love thee not a jar o' the clock behindWhat lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

POLIXENES

No, madam.

HERMIONE

Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES

                  I may not, verily.

HERMIONE

Verily!You put me off with limber vows; but I,Though you would seek to unsphere thestars with oaths,Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 'sAs potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?Force me to keep you as a prisoner,Not like a guest; so you shall pay your feesWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'One of them you shall be.

POLIXENES

Your guest, then, madam:To be your prisoner should import offending;Which is for me less easy to commitThan you to punish.

HERMIONE

Not your gaoler, then,But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question youOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES

We were, fair queen,Two lads that thought there was no more behindBut such a day to-morrow as to-day,And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE

Was not my lordThe verier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES

We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,And bleat the one at the other: what we changedWas innocence for innocence; we knew notThe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'dThat any did. Had we pursued that life,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'dWith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heavenBoldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'dHereditary ours.

HERMIONE

                  By this we gatherYou have tripp'd since.

POLIXENES

O my most sacred lady!Temptations have since then been born to's; forIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl;Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyesOf my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE

Grace to boot!Of this make no conclusion, lest you sayYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;The offences we have made you do we'll answer,If you first sinn'd with us and that with usYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd notWith any but with us.

LEONTES

Is he won yet?

HERMIONE

He'll stay my lord.

LEONTES

At my request he would not.Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokestTo better purpose.

HERMIONE

                                 Never?

LEONTES

Never, but once.

HERMIONE

What! have I twice said well? when was't before?I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make'sAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tonguelessSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.Our praises are our wages: you may ride'sWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ereWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:My last good deed was to entreat his stay:What was my first? it has an elder sister,Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES

Why, that was whenThree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,Ere I could make thee open thy white handAnd clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter'I am yours for ever.'

HERMIONE

'Tis grace indeed.Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES

[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;But not for joy; not joy. This entertainmentMay a free face put on, derive a libertyFrom heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,As now they are, and making practised smiles,As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twereThe mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainmentMy bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,Art thou my boy?

MAMILLIUS

                           Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES

I' fecks!Why, that's my bawcock. What, hastsmutch'd thy nose?They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:And yet the steer, the heifer and the calfAre all call'd neat.--Still virginallingUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS

                  Yes, if you will, my lord.

LEONTES

Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,To be full like me: yet they say we areAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,That will say anything but were they falseAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, falseAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixesNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it trueTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:Thou dost make possible things not so held,Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--With what's unreal thou coactive art,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credentThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,And that beyond commission, and I find it,And that to the infection of my brainsAnd hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES

What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE

He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES

How, my lord!What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

HERMIONE

You look as if you held a brow of much distractionAre you moved, my lord?

LEONTES

No, in good earnest.How sometimes nature will betray its folly,Its tenderness, and make itself a pastimeTo harder bosoms! Looking on the linesOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoilTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS

No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES

You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,Are you so fond of your young prince as weDo seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES

If at home, sir,He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:He makes a July's day short as December,And with his varying childness cures in meThoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES

So stands this squireOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:Next to thyself and my young rover, he'sApparent to my heart.

HERMIONE

If you would seek us,We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES

To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,Be you beneath the sky.Aside
I am angling now,Though you perceive me not how I give line.Go to, go to!How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!And arms her with the boldness of a wifeTo her allowing husband!Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants
Gone already!Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head andears a fork'd one!Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and IPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issueWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamourWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.There have been,Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;And many a man there is, even at this present,Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absenceAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, bySir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in'tWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,As mine, against their will. Should all despairThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankindWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;It is a bawdy planet, that will strikeWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,No barricado for a belly; know't;It will let in and out the enemyWith bag and baggage: many thousand on'sHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS

I am like you, they say.

LEONTES

Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO

Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES

Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.Exit MAMILLIUS
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

CAMILLO

You had much ado to make his anchor hold:When you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES

Didst note it?

CAMILLO

He would not stay at your petitions: madeHis business more material.

LEONTES

Didst perceive it?Aside
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,That he did stay?

CAMILLO

                  At the good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES

At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinentBut, so it is, it is not. Was this takenBy any understanding pate but thine?For thy conceit is soaking, will draw inMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,But of the finer natures? by some severalsOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messesPerchance are to this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO

Business, my lord! I think most understandBohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES

Ha!

CAMILLO

Stays here longer.

LEONTES

Ay, but why?

CAMILLO

To satisfy your highness and the entreatiesOf our most gracious mistress.

LEONTES

Satisfy!The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,With all the nearest things to my heart, as wellMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thouHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departedThy penitent reform'd: but we have beenDeceived in thy integrity, deceivedIn that which seems so.

CAMILLO

Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES

To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,Which hoxes honesty behind, restrainingFrom course required; or else thou must be countedA servant grafted in my serious trustAnd therein negligent; or else a foolThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO

My gracious lord,I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;In every one of these no man is free,But that his negligence, his folly, fear,Among the infinite doings of the world,Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,If ever I were wilful-negligent,It was my folly; if industriouslyI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,Not weighing well the end; if ever fearfulTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,Where of the execution did cry outAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fearWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,Are such allow'd infirmities that honestyIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,Be plainer with me; let me know my trespassBy its own visage: if I then deny it,'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES

                  Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glassIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--For to a vision so apparent rumourCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitationResides not in that man that does not think,--My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,Or else be impudently negative,To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then sayMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a nameAs rank as any flax-wench that puts toBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO

I would not be a stander-by to hearMy sovereign mistress clouded so, withoutMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,You never spoke what did become you lessThan this; which to reiterate were sinAs deep as that, though true.

LEONTES

Is whispering nothing?Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?Kissing with inside lip? stopping the careerOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallibleOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyesBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,If this be nothing.

CAMILLO

Good my lord, be curedOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES

Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO

No, no, my lord.

LEONTES

                  It is; you lie, you lie:I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,Or else a hovering temporizer, thatCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,Inclining to them both: were my wife's liverInfected as her life, she would not liveThe running of one glass.

CAMILLO

Who does infect her?

LEONTES

Why, he that wears her like a medal, hangingAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if IHad servants true about me, that bare eyesTo see alike mine honour as their profits,Their own particular thrifts, they would do thatWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner formHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst seePlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,To give mine enemy a lasting wink;Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILLO

Sir, my lord,I could do this, and that with no rash potion,But with a lingering dram that should not workMaliciously like poison: but I cannotBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,So sovereignly being honourable.I have loved thee,--

LEONTES

Make that thy question, and go rot!Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,To appoint myself in this vexation, sullyThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,Which to preserve is sleep, which being spottedIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,Who I do think is mine and love as mine,Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?Could man so blench?

CAMILLO

I must believe you, sir:I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;Provided that, when he's removed, your highnessWill take again your queen as yours at first,Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealingThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdomsKnown and allied to yours.

LEONTES

Thou dost advise meEven so as I mine own course have set down:I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO

My lord,Go then; and with a countenance as clearAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with BohemiaAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:If from me he have wholesome beverage,Account me not your servant.

LEONTES

This is all:Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO

I'll do't, my lord.

LEONTES

I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.Exit


CAMILLO

O miserable lady! But, for me,What case stand I in? I must be the poisonerOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do'tIs the obedience to a master, oneWho in rebellion with himself will haveAll that are his so too. To do this deed,Promotion follows. If I could find exampleOf thousands that had struck anointed kingsAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but sinceNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,Let villany itself forswear't. I mustForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certainTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!Here comes Bohemia.Re-enter POLIXENES


POLIXENES

This is strange: methinksMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO

                  Hail, most royal sir!

POLIXENES

What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO

None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES

The king hath on him such a countenanceAs he had lost some province and a regionLoved as he loves himself: even now I met himWith customary compliment; when he,Wafting his eyes to the contrary and fallingA lip of much contempt, speeds from me andSo leaves me to consider what is breedingThat changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO

I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES

How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,Your changed complexions are to me a mirrorWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must beA party in this alteration, findingMyself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO

There is a sicknessWhich puts some of us in distemper, butI cannot name the disease; and it is caughtOf you that yet are well.

POLIXENES

How! caught of me!Make me not sighted like the basilisk:I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the betterBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--As you are certainly a gentleman, theretoClerk-like experienced, which no less adornsOur gentry than our parents' noble names,In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,If you know aught which does behove my knowledgeThereof to be inform'd, imprison't notIn ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO

I may not answer.

POLIXENES

A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,I conjure thee, by all the parts of manWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the leastIs not this suit of mine, that thou declareWhat incidency thou dost guess of harmIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;Which way to be prevented, if to be;If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO

Sir, I will tell you;Since I am charged in honour and by himThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,Which must be even as swiftly follow'd asI mean to utter it, or both yourself and meCry lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES

On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO

I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES

By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO

                        By the king.

POLIXENES

For what?

CAMILLO

He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,As he had seen't or been an instrumentTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queenForbiddenly.

POLIXENES

                  O, then my best blood turnTo an infected jelly and my nameBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!Turn then my freshest reputation toA savour that may strike the dullest nostrilWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infectionThat e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO

Swear his thought overBy each particular star in heaven andBy all their influences, you may as wellForbid the sea for to obey the moonAs or by oath remove or counsel shakeThe fabric of his folly, whose foundationIs piled upon his faith and will continueThe standing of his body.

POLIXENES

How should this grow?

CAMILLO

I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer toAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.If therefore you dare trust my honesty,That lies enclosed in this trunk which youShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!Your followers I will whisper to the business,And will by twos and threes at several posternsClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll putMy fortunes to your service, which are hereBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;For, by the honour of my parents, IHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,I dare not stand by; nor shall you be saferThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereonHis execution sworn.

POLIXENES

I do believe thee:I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:Be pilot to me and thy places shallStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready andMy people did expect my hence departureTwo days ago. This jealousyIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,Must it be violent, and as he does conceiveHe is dishonour'd by a man which everProfess'd to him, why, his revenges mustIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:Good expedition be my friend, and comfortThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothingOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;I will respect thee as a father ifThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO

It is in mine authority to commandThe keys of all the posterns: please your highnessTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies


HERMIONE

Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,'Tis past enduring.

First Lady

Come, my gracious lord,Shall I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS

No, I'll none of you.

First Lady

Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS

You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as ifI were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Lady

And why so, my lord?

MAMILLIUS

Not for becauseYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,Become some women best, so that there be notToo much hair there, but in a semicircleOr a half-moon made with a pen.

Second Lady

Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS

I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray nowWhat colour are your eyebrows?

First Lady

Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS

Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's noseThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady

Hark ye;The queen your mother rounds apace: we shallPresent our services to a fine new princeOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,If we would have you.

Second Lady

She is spread of lateInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE

What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, nowI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS

Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE

As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS

A sad tale's best for winter: I have oneOf sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE

Let's have that, good sir.Come on, sit down: come on, and do your bestTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS

There was a man--

HERMIONE

                  Nay, come, sit down; then on.

MAMILLIUS

Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;Yond crickets shall not hear it.

HERMIONE

Come on, then,And give't me in mine ear.Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others


LEONTES

Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord

Behind the tuft of pines I met them; neverSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed themEven to their ships.

LEONTES

How blest am IIn my just censure, in my true opinion!Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursedIn being so blest! There may be in the cupA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,And yet partake no venom, for his knowledgeIs not infected: but if one presentThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make knownHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,With violent hefts. I have drunk,and seen the spider.Camillo was his help in this, his pander:There is a plot against my life, my crown;All's true that is mistrusted: that false villainWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:He has discover'd my design, and IRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trickFor them to play at will. How came the posternsSo easily open?

First Lord

                  By his great authority;Which often hath no less prevail'd than soOn your command.

LEONTES

                          I know't too well.Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:Though he does bear some signs of me, yet youHave too much blood in him.

HERMIONE

What is this? sport?

LEONTES

Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;Away with him! and let her sport herselfWith that she's big with; for 'tis PolixenesHas made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE

But I'ld say he had not,And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES

You, my lords,Look on her, mark her well; be but aboutTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' andThe justice of your bearts will thereto add'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'Praise her but for this her without-door form,Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straightThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brandsThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--That mercy does, for calumny will searVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,When you have said 'she's goodly,' come betweenEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE

Should a villain say so,The most replenish'd villain in the world,He were as much more villain: you, my lord,Do but mistake.

LEONTES

                  You have mistook, my lady,Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,Should a like language use to all degreesAnd mannerly distinguishment leave outBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have saidShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:More, she's a traitor and Camillo isA federary with her, and one that knowsWhat she should shame to know herselfBut with her most vile principal, that she'sA bed-swerver, even as bad as thoseThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privyTo this their late escape.

HERMIONE

No, by my life.Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,When you shall come to clearer knowledge, thatYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,You scarce can right me throughly then to sayYou did mistake.

LEONTES

                  No; if I mistakeIn those foundations which I build upon,The centre is not big enough to bearA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!He who shall speak for her is afar off guiltyBut that he speaks.

HERMIONE

There's some ill planet reigns:I must be patient till the heavens lookWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,I am not prone to weeping, as our sexCommonly are; the want of which vain dewPerchance shall dry your pities: but I haveThat honourable grief lodged here which burnsWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,With thoughts so qualified as your charitiesShall best instruct you, measure me; and soThe king's will be perform'd!

LEONTES

Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE

Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,My women may be with me; for you seeMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;There is no cause: when you shall know your mistressHas deserved prison, then abound in tearsAs I come out: this action I now go onIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:I never wish'd to see you sorry; nowI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONTES

Go, do our bidding; hence!Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies


First Lord

Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS

Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justiceProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord

For her, my lord,I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotlessI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,In this which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS

If it proveShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables whereI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;For every inch of woman in the world,Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

LEONTES

         Hold your peaces.

First Lord

Good my lord,--

ANTIGONUS

It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:You are abused and by some putter-onThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,I have three daughters; the eldest is elevenThe second and the third, nine, and some five;If this prove true, they'll pay for't:by mine honour,I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;And I had rather glib myself than theyShould not produce fair issue.

LEONTES

Cease; no more.You smell this business with a sense as coldAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel'tAs you feel doing thus; and see withalThe instruments that feel.

ANTIGONUS

If it be so,We need no grave to bury honesty:There's not a grain of it the face to sweetenOf the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES

What! lack I credit?

First Lord

I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,Upon this ground; and more it would content meTo have her honour true than your suspicion,Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES

Why, what need weCommune with you of this, but rather followOur forceful instigation? Our prerogativeCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodnessImparts this; which if you, or stupefiedOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will notRelish a truth like us, inform yourselvesWe need no more of your advice: the matter,The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is allProperly ours.

ANTIGONUS

                  And I wish, my liege,You had only in your silent judgment tried it,Without more overture.

LEONTES

How could that be?Either thou art most ignorant by age,Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,Added to their familiarity,Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,That lack'd sight only, nought for approbationBut only seeing, all other circumstancesMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:Yet, for a greater confirmation,For in an act of this importance 'twereMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in postTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,Cleomenes and Dion, whom you knowOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracleThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

First Lord

Well done, my lord.

LEONTES

Though I am satisfied and need no moreThan what I know, yet shall the oracleGive rest to the minds of others, such as heWhose ignorant credulity will notCome up to the truth. So have we thought it goodFrom our free person she should be confined,Lest that the treachery of the two fled henceBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;We are to speak in public; for this businessWill raise us all.

ANTIGONUS

[Aside]To laughter, as I take it,If the good truth were known.Exeunt

Good lady,No court in Europe is too good for thee;What dost thou then in prison?Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler
Now, good sir,You know me, do you not?

Gaoler

For a worthy ladyAnd one whom much I honour.

PAULINA

Pray you then,Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler

I may not, madam:To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA

Here's ado,To lock up honesty and honour fromThe access of gentle visitors!Is't lawful, pray you,To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler

So please you, madam,To put apart these your attendants, IShall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA

I pray now, call her.Withdraw yourselves.Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants


Gaoler

And, madam,I must be present at your conference.

PAULINA

Well, be't so, prithee.Exit Gaoler
Here's such ado to make no stain a stainAs passes colouring.Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA
Dear gentlewoman,How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA

As well as one so great and so forlornMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,Which never tender lady hath born greater,She is something before her time deliver'd.

PAULINA

A boy?

EMILIA

     A daughter, and a goodly babe,Lusty and like to live: the queen receivesMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,I am innocent as you.'

PAULINA

I dare be swornThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,beshrew them!He must be told on't, and he shall: the officeBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blisterAnd never to my red-look'd anger beThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,Commend my best obedience to the queen:If she dares trust me with her little babe,I'll show't the king and undertake to beHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not knowHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:The silence often of pure innocencePersuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA

Most worthy madam,Your honour and your goodness is so evidentThat your free undertaking cannot missA thriving issue: there is no lady livingSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyshipTo visit the next room, I'll presentlyAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;Who  but to-day hammer'd of this design,But durst not tempt a minister of honour,Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA

Tell her, Emilia.I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from'tAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubtedI shall do good.

EMILIA

                  Now be you blest for it!I'll to the queen: please you,come something nearer.

Gaoler

Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,I know not what I shall incur to pass it,Having no warrant.

PAULINA

                  You need not fear it, sir:This child was prisoner to the womb and isBy law and process of great nature thenceFreed and enfranchised, not a party toThe anger of the king nor guilty of,If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler

I do believe it.

PAULINA

                  Do not you fear: upon mine honour,I will stand betwixt you and danger.Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.

Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants


LEONTES

Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weaknessTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. IfThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,She the adulteress; for the harlot kingIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blankAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but sheI can hook to me: say that she were gone,Given to the fire, a moiety of my restMight come to me again. Who's there?

First Servant

My lord?

LEONTES

How does the boy?

First Servant

                  He took good rest to-night;'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES

To see his nobleness!Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,See how he fares.Exit Servant
Fie, fie! no thought of him:The thought of my revenges that wayRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,And in his parties, his alliance; let him beUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,Take it on her. Camillo and PolixenesLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:They should not laugh if I could reach them, norShall she within my power.Enter PAULINA, with a child


First Lord

You must not enter.

PAULINA

Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS

That's enough.

Second Servant

Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commandedNone should come at him.

PAULINA

Not so hot, good sir:I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,That creep like shadows by him and do sighAt each his needless heavings, such as youNourish the cause of his awaking: IDo come with words as medicinal as true,Honest as either, to purge him of that humourThat presses him from sleep.

LEONTES

What noise there, ho?

PAULINA

No noise, my lord; but needful conferenceAbout some gossips for your highness.

LEONTES

How!Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,I charged thee that she should not come about me:I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS

                  I told her so, my lord,On your displeasure's peril and on mine,She should not visit you.

LEONTES

What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA

From all dishonesty he can: in this,Unless he take the course that you have done,Commit me for committing honour, trust it,He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS

La you now, you hear:When she will take the rein I let her run;But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA

Good my liege, I come;And, I beseech you, hear me, who professMyself your loyal servant, your physician,Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dareLess appear so in comforting your evils,Than such as most seem yours: I say, I comeFrom your good queen.

LEONTES

Good queen!

PAULINA

Good queen, my lord,Good queen; I say good queen;And would by combat make her good, so were IA man, the worst about you.

LEONTES

Force her hence.

PAULINA

Let him that makes but trifles of his eyesFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.Laying down the child


LEONTES

Out!A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:A most intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA

Not so:I am as ignorant in that as youIn so entitling me, and no less honestThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEONTES

Traitors!Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroostedBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA

For everUnvenerable be thy hands, if thouTakest up the princess by that forced basenessWhich he has put upon't!

LEONTES

He dreads his wife.

PAULINA

So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubtYou'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES

A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS

I am none, by this good light.

PAULINA

Nor I, nor anyBut one that's here, and that's himself, for heThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;and will not--For, as the case now stands, it is a curseHe cannot be compell'd to't--once removeThe root of his opinion, which is rottenAs ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES

A callatOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husbandAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;It is the issue of Polixenes:Hence with it, and together with the damCommit them to the fire!

PAULINA

It is yours;And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,Although the print be little, the whole matterAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,His smiles,The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made itSo like to him that got it, if thou hastThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all coloursNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,Her children not her husband's!

LEONTES

A gross hagAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS

Hang all the husbandsThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourselfHardly one subject.

LEONTES

Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA

A most unworthy and unnatural lordCan do no more.

LEONTES

                  I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA

I care not:It is an heretic that makes the fire,Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;But this most cruel usage of your queen,Not able to produce more accusationThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savoursOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,Yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES

On your allegiance,Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,Where were her life? she durst not call me so,If she did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA

I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:Jove send herA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,Will never do him good, not one of you.So, so: farewell; we are gone.Exit


LEONTES

Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.My child? away with't! Even thou, that hastA heart so tender o'er it, take it henceAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuseAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;The bastard brains with these my proper handsShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;For thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS

I did not, sir:These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,Can clear me in't.

Lords

                  We can: my royal liege,He is not guilty of her coming hither.

LEONTES

You're liars all.

First Lord

Beseech your highness, give us better credit:We have always truly served you, and beseech youSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,As recompense of our dear servicesPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,Which being so horrible, so bloody, mustLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES

I am a feather for each wind that blows:Shall I live on to see this bastard kneelAnd call me father? better burn it nowThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;You that have been so tenderly officiousWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,So sure as this beard's grey,--what will you adventureTo save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS

Any thing, my lord,That my ability may undergoAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:I'll pawn the little blood which I have leftTo save the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES

It shall be possible. Swear by this swordThou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS

I will, my lord.

LEONTES

Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the failOf any point in't shall not only beDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carryThis female bastard hence and that thou bear itTo some remote and desert place quite outOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,Without more mercy, to its own protectionAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortuneIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,That thou commend it strangely to some placeWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS

I swear to do this, though a present deathHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravensTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they sayCasting their savageness aside have doneLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperousIn more than this deed does require! And blessingAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!Exit with the child

CLEOMENES

The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassingThe common praise it bears.

DION

I shall report,For most it caught me, the celestial habits,Methinks I so should term them, and the reverenceOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!How ceremonious, solemn and unearthlyIt was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES

But of all, the burstAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.That I was nothing.

DION

If the event o' the journeyProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,The time is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES

Great ApolloTurn all to the best! These proclamations,So forcing faults upon Hermione,I little like.

DION

                  The violent carriage of itWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,Shall the contents discover, something rareEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!And gracious be the issue!Exeunt

SCENE II. A court of Justice.

LEONTES

Read the indictment.

Officer

[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthyLeontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused andarraigned of high treason, in committing adulterywith Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiringwith Camillo to take away the life of our sovereignlord the king, thy royal husband: the pretencewhereof being by circumstances partly laid open,thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegianceof a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, fortheir better safety, to fly away by night.

HERMIONE

Since what I am to say must be but thatWhich contradicts my accusation andThe testimony on my part no otherBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot meTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrityBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,Be so received. But thus: if powers divineBehold our human actions, as they do,I doubt not then but innocence shall makeFalse accusation blush and tyrannyTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,Who least will seem to do so, my past lifeHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,As I am now unhappy; which is moreThan history can pattern, though devisedAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold meA fellow of the royal bed, which oweA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,The mother to a hopeful prince, here standingTo prate and talk for life and honour 'foreWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize itAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,'Tis a derivative from me to mine,And only that I stand for. I appealTo your own conscience, sir, before PolixenesCame to your court, how I was in your grace,How merited to be so; since he came,With what encounter so uncurrent IHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyondThe bound of honour, or in act or willThat way inclining, harden'd be the heartsOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kinCry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES

I ne'er heard yetThat any of these bolder vices wantedLess impudence to gainsay what they didThan to perform it first.

HERMIONE

That's true enough;Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

LEONTES

You will not own it.

HERMIONE

More than mistress ofWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must notAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,With whom I am accused, I do confessI loved him as in honour he required,With such a kind of love as might becomeA lady like me, with a love even such,So and no other, as yourself commanded:Which not to have done I think had been in meBoth disobedience and ingratitudeTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,Even since it could speak, from an infant, freelyThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'dFor me to try how: all I know of itIs that Camillo was an honest man;And why he left your court, the gods themselves,Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES

You knew of his departure, as you knowWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE

Sir,You speak a language that I understand not:My life stands in the level of your dreams,Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES

Your actions are my dreams;You had a bastard by Polixenes,And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:Which to deny concerns more than avails; for asThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,No father owning it,--which is, indeed,More criminal in thee than it,--so thouShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passageLook for no less than death.

HERMIONE

Sir, spare your threats:The bug which you would fright me with I seek.To me can life be no commodity:The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,But know not how it went. My second joyAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presenceI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfortStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,Haled out to murder: myself on every postProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatredThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longsTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurriedHere to this place, i' the open air, beforeI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,Tell me what blessings I have here alive,That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'dUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping elseBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,I do refer me to the oracle:Apollo be my judge!

First Lord

This your requestIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,And in Apollos name, his oracle.Exeunt certain Officers

Apollo, pardonMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;For, being transported by my jealousiesTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I choseCamillo for the minister to poisonMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,But that the good mind of Camillo tardiedMy swift command, though I with death and withReward did threaten and encourage him,Not doing 't and being done: he, most humaneAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guestUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,Which you knew great, and to the hazardOf all encertainties himself commended,No richer than his honour: how he glistersThorough my rust! and how his pityDoes my deeds make the blacker!Re-enter PAULINA

What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?In leads or oils? what old or newer tortureMust I receive, whose every word deservesTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyrannyTogether working with thy jealousies,Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idleFor girls of nine, O, think what they have doneAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for allThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstantAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckonThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughterTo be or none or little; though a devilWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:Nor is't directly laid to thee, the deathOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heartThat could conceive a gross and foolish sireBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,and vengeance for'tNot dropp'd down yet.

First Lord

The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA

I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oathPrevail not, go and see: if you can bringTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve youAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!Do not repent these things, for they are heavierThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake theeTo nothing but despair. A thousand kneesTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,Upon a barren mountain and still winterIn storm perpetual, could not move the godsTo look that way thou wert.

LEONTES

Go on, go onThou canst not speak too much; I have deservedAll tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord

Say no more:Howe'er the business goes, you have made faultI' the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA

I am sorry for't:All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too muchThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'dTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past helpShould be past grief: do not receive afflictionAt my petition; I beseech you, ratherLet me be punish'd, that have minded youOf what you should forget. Now, good my liegeSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;I'll not remember you of my own lord,Who is lost too: take your patience to you,And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES

Thou didst speak but wellWhen most the truth; which I receive much betterThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring meTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:One grave shall be for both: upon them shallThe causes of their death appear, untoOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visitThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed thereShall be my recreation: so long as natureWill bear up with this exercise, so longI daily vow to use it. Come and lead meUnto these sorrows.Exeunt

SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.

Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner


ANTIGONUS

Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd uponThe deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner

Ay, my lord: and fearWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimlyAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,The heavens with that we have in hand are angryAnd frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS

Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;Look to thy bark: I'll not be long beforeI call upon thee.

Mariner

Make your best haste, and go notToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;Besides, this place is famous for the creaturesOf prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS

Go thou away:I'll follow instantly.

Mariner

I am glad at heartTo be so rid o' the business.Exit


ANTIGONUS

Come, poor babe:I have heard, but not believed,the spirits o' the deadMay walk again: if such thing be, thy motherAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dreamSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,Sometimes her head on one side, some another;I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,Like very sanctity, she did approachMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,And gasping to begin some speech, her eyesBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anonDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,Since fate, against thy better disposition,Hath made thy person for the thrower-outOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,Places remote enough are in Bohemia,There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babeIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,I prithee, call't. For this ungentle businessPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt seeThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieksShe melted into air. Affrighted much,I did in time collect myself and thoughtThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,I will be squared by this. I do believeHermione hath suffer'd death, and thatApollo would, this being indeed the issueOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,Either for life or death, upon the earthOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!There lie, and there thy character: there these;Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,That for thy mother's fault art thus exposedTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am ITo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to haveA lullaby too rough: I never sawThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:I am gone for ever.Exit, pursued by a bear
Enter a Shepherd


Shepherd

I would there were no age between sixteen andthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out therest; for there is nothing in the between butgetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any butthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twentyhunt this weather? They have scared away two of mybest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner findthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis bythe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thywill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a verypretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? Apretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:though I am not bookish, yet I can readwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has beensome stair-work, some trunk-work, somebehind-door-work: they were warmer that got thisthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up forpity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooedbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!Enter Clown


Clown

Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd

What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talkon when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. Whatailest thou, man?

Clown

I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now thesky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrusta bodkin's point.

Shepherd

Why, boy, how is it?

Clown

I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,how it takes up the shore! but that's not thepoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now theship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anonswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust acork into a hogshead. And then for theland-service, to see how the bear tore out hisshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and saidhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make anend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragonedit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and thesea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roaredand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder thanthe sea or weather.

Shepherd

Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown

Now, now: I have not winked since I saw thesesights: the men are not yet cold under water, northe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at itnow.

Shepherd

Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown

I would you had been by the ship side, to havehelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd

Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thingsdying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight forthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire'schild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should berich by the fairies. This is some changeling:open't. What's within, boy?

Clown

You're a made old man: if the sins of your youthare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd

This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: upwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requiresnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, goodboy, the next way home.

Clown

Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go seeif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how muchhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when theyare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll buryit.

Shepherd

That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by thatwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to thesight of him.

Clown

Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd

'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.Exeunt

ACT IV

SCENE I:Enter Time, the Chorus


Time

I, that please some, try all, both joy and terrorOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,Now take upon me, in the name of Time,To use my wings. Impute it not a crimeTo me or my swift passage, that I slideO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untriedOf that wide gap, since it is in my powerTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hourTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me passThe same I am, ere ancient'st order wasOr what is now received: I witness toThe times that brought them in; so shall I doTo the freshest things now reigning and make staleThe glistering of this present, as my taleNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,I turn my glass and give my scene such growingAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,The effects of his fond jealousies so grievingThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,Gentle spectators, that I now may beIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,I mentioned a son o' the king's, which FlorizelI now name to you; and with speed so paceTo speak of Perdita, now grown in graceEqual with wondering: what of her ensuesI list not prophecy; but let Time's newsBe known when 'tis brought forth.A shepherd's daughter,And what to her adheres, which follows after,Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,If ever you have spent time worse ere now;If never, yet that Time himself doth sayHe wishes earnestly you never may.Exit

SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.

Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO


POLIXENES

I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death togrant this.

CAMILLO

It is fifteen years since I saw my country: thoughI have for the most part been aired abroad, Idesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitentking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feelingsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween tothink so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES

As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest ofthy services by leaving me now: the need I have ofthee thine own goodness hath made; better not tohave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, havingmade me businesses which none without thee cansufficiently manage, must either stay to executethem thyself or take away with thee the veryservices thou hast done; which if I have not enoughconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be morethankful to thee shall be my study, and my profittherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatalcountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose verynaming punishes me with the remembrance of thatpenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,my brother; whose loss of his most precious queenand children are even now to be afresh lamented.Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, myson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue notbeing gracious, than they are in losing them whenthey have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO

Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. Whathis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but Ihave missingly noted, he is of late much retiredfrom court and is less frequent to his princelyexercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES

I have considered so much, Camillo, and with somecare; so far that I have eyes under my service whichlook upon his removedness; from whom I have thisintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of amost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that fromvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of hisneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO

I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath adaughter of most rare note: the report of her isextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES

That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, Ifear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thoushalt accompany us to the place; where we will, notappearing what we are, have some question with theshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it notuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.Prithee, be my present partner in this business, andlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO

I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES

My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.Exeunt

SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.

Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing


AUTOLYCUS

When daffodils begin to peer,With heigh! the doxy over the dale,Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,Are summer songs for me and my aunts,While we lie tumbling in the hay.I have served Prince Florizel and in my timewore three-pile; but now I am out of service:But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?The pale moon shines by night:And when I wander here and there,I then do most go right.If tinkers may have leave to live,And bear the sow-skin budget,Then my account I well may, give,And in the stocks avouch it.My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look tolesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; whobeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewisea snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die anddrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue isthe silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerfulon the highway: beating and hanging are terrors tome: for the life to come, I sleep out the thoughtof it. A prize! a prize!Enter Clown


Clown

Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every todyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundredshorn. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS

[Aside]If the springe hold, the cock's mine.

Clown

I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what amI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three poundof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what willthis sister of mine do with rice? But my fatherhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays iton. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays forthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very goodones; but they are most of them means and bases; butone puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms tohorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the wardenpies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that Imay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many ofraisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS

O that ever I was born!Grovelling on the ground


Clown

I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS

O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; andthen, death, death!

Clown

Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to layon thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS

O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me morethan the stripes I have received, which are mightyones and millions.

Clown

Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to agreat matter.

AUTOLYCUS

I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparelta'en from me, and these detestable things put uponme.

Clown

What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS

A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown

Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments hehas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS

O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown

Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS

O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, myshoulder-blade is out.

Clown

How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS

[Picking his pocket]Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done mea charitable office.

Clown

Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS

No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I havea kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, orany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;that kills my heart.

Clown

What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS

A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about withtroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of theprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of hisvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown

His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whippedout of the court: they cherish it to make it staythere; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS

Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: hehath been since an ape-bearer; then aprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed amotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker'swife within a mile where my land and living lies;and, having flown over many knavish professions, hesettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown

Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he hauntswakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS

Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue thatput me into this apparel.

Clown

Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you hadbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS

I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I amfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warranthim.

Clown

How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS

Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand andwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pacesoftly towards my kinsman's.

Clown

Shall I bring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS

No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown

Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for oursheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS

Prosper you, sweet sir!Exit Clown
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if Imake not this cheat bring out another and theshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my nameput in the book of virtue!Sings
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,And merrily hent the stile-a:A merry heart goes all the day,Your sad tires in a mile-a.Exit

SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.

Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA


FLORIZEL

These your unusual weeds to each part of youDo give a life: no shepherdess, but FloraPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearingIs as a meeting of the petty gods,And you the queen on't.

PERDITA

Sir, my gracious lord,To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscuredWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feastsIn every mess have folly and the feedersDigest it with a custom, I should blushTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL

I bless the timeWhen my good falcon made her flight acrossThy father's ground.

PERDITA

Now Jove afford you cause!To me the difference forges dread; your greatnessHath not been used to fear. Even now I trembleTo think your father, by some accident,Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!How would he look, to see his work so nobleVilely bound up? What would he say? Or howShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, beholdThe sternness of his presence?

FLORIZEL

ApprehendNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,Humbling their deities to love, have takenThe shapes of beasts upon them: JupiterBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green NeptuneA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,As I seem now. Their transformationsWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,Nor in a way so chaste, since my desiresRun not before mine honour, nor my lustsBurn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA

O, but, sir,Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tisOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:One of these two must be necessities,Which then will speak, that you mustchange this purpose,Or I my life.

FLORIZEL

                  Thou dearest Perdita,With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken notThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,Or not my father's. For I cannot beMine own, nor any thing to any, ifI be not thine. To this I am most constant,Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;Strangle such thoughts as these with any thingThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:Lift up your countenance, as it were the dayOf celebration of that nuptial whichWe two have sworn shall come.

PERDITA

O lady Fortune,Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL

See, your guests approach:Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,And let's be red with mirth.Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised


Shepherd

Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, uponThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fireWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,She would to each one sip. You are retired,As if you were a feasted one and notThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bidThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it isA way to make us better friends, more known.Come, quench your blushes and present yourselfThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,As your good flock shall prosper.

PERDITA

[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:It is my father's will I should take on meThe hostess-ship o' the day.To CAMILLO
You're welcome, sir.Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,For you there's rosemary and rue; these keepSeeming and savour all the winter long:Grace and remembrance be to you both,And welcome to our shearing!

POLIXENES

Shepherdess,A fair one are you--well you fit our agesWith flowers of winter.

PERDITA

Sir, the year growing ancient,Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birthOf trembling winter, the fairestflowers o' the seasonAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,Which some call nature's bastards: of that kindOur rustic garden's barren; and I care notTo get slips of them.

POLIXENES

Wherefore, gentle maiden,Do you neglect them?

PERDITA

For I have heard it saidThere is an art which in their piedness sharesWith great creating nature.

POLIXENES

Say there be;Yet nature is made better by no meanBut nature makes that mean: so, over that artWhich you say adds to nature, is an artThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marryA gentler scion to the wildest stock,And make conceive a bark of baser kindBy bud of nobler race: this is an artWhich does mend nature, change it rather, butThe art itself is nature.

PERDITA

So it is.

POLIXENES

Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA

I'll not putThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;No more than were I painted I would wishThis youth should say 'twere well and only thereforeDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sunAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowersOf middle summer, and I think they are givenTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO

I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,And only live by gazing.

PERDITA

Out, alas!You'd be so lean, that blasts of JanuaryWould blow you through and through.Now, my fair'st friend,I would I had some flowers o' the spring that mightBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,That wear upon your virgin branches yetYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fallFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,That come before the swallow dares, and takeThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyesOr Cytherea's breath; pale primrosesThat die unmarried, ere they can beholdBight Phoebus in his strength--a maladyMost incident to maids; bold oxlips andThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL

What, like a corse?

PERDITA

No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:Methinks I play as I have seen them doIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mineDoes change my disposition.

FLORIZEL

What you doStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish youA wave o' the sea, that you might ever doNothing but that; move still, still so,And own no other function: each your doing,So singular in each particular,Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,That all your acts are queens.

PERDITA

O Doricles,Your praises are too large: but that your youth,And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,You woo'd me the false way.

FLORIZEL

I think you haveAs little skill to fear as I have purposeTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,That never mean to part.

PERDITA

I'll swear for 'em.

POLIXENES

This is the prettiest low-born lass that everRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seemsBut smacks of something greater than herself,Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO

He tells her somethingThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she isThe queen of curds and cream.

Clown

Come on, strike up!

DORCAS

Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,To mend her kissing with!

MOPSA

Now, in good time!

Clown

Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.Come, strike up!Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses


POLIXENES

Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is thisWhich dances with your daughter?

Shepherd

They call him Doricles; and boasts himselfTo have a worthy feeding: but I have itUpon his own report and I believe it;He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:I think so too; for never gazed the moonUpon the water as he'll stand and readAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.I think there is not half a kiss to chooseWho loves another best.

POLIXENES

She dances featly.

Shepherd

So she does any thing; though I report it,That should be silent: if young DoriclesDo light upon her, she shall bring him thatWhich he not dreams of.Enter Servant


Servant

O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at thedoor, you would never dance again after a tabour andpipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he singsseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; heutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men'sears grew to his tunes.

Clown

He could never come better; he shall come in. Ilove a ballad but even too well, if it be dolefulmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thingindeed and sung lamentably.

Servant

He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; nomilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: hehas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so withoutbawdry, which is strange; with such delicateburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thumpher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap intothe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do meno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES

This is a brave fellow.

Clown

Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceitedfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Servant

He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia canlearnedly handle, though they come to him by thegross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, hesings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; youwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chantsto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

Clown

Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDITA

Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.Exit Servant


Clown

You have of these pedlars, that have more in themthan you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA

Ay, good brother, or go about to think.Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing


AUTOLYCUS

     Lawn as white as driven snow;Cyprus black as e'er was crow;Gloves as sweet as damask roses;Masks for faces and for noses;Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,Perfume for a lady's chamber;Golden quoifs and stomachers,For my lads to give their dears:Pins and poking-sticks of steel,What maids lack from head to heel:Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown

If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst takeno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, itwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA

I was promised them against the feast; but they comenot too late now.

DORCAS

He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA

He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he haspaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown

Is there no manners left among maids? will theywear their plackets where they should bear theirfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you aregoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off thesesecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before allour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamouryour tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA

I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-laceand a pair of sweet gloves.

Clown

Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the wayand lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS

And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown

Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS

I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

Clown

What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA

Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS

Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer'swife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at aburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads andtoads carbonadoed.

MOPSA

Is it true, think you?

AUTOLYCUS

Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS

Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS

Here's the midwife's name to't, one MistressTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that werepresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA

Pray you now, buy it.

Clown

Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moeballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS

Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared uponthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,forty thousand fathom above water, and sung thisballad against the hard hearts of maids: it wasthought she was a woman and was turned into a coldfish for she would not exchange flesh with one thatloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS

Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS

Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more thanmy pack will hold.

Clown

Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS

This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

MOPSA

Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS

Why, this is a passing merry one and goes tothe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there'sscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis inrequest, I can tell you.

MOPSA

We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thoushalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

DORCAS

We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS

I can bear my part; you must know 'tis myoccupation; have at it with you.SONG


AUTOLYCUS

Get you hence, for I must goWhere it fits not you to know.

DORCAS

     Whither?

MOPSA

                  O, whither?

DORCAS

Whither?

MOPSA

     It becomes thy oath full well,Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS

          Me too, let me go thither.

MOPSA

     Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS

     If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS

Neither.

DORCAS

       What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS

Neither.

DORCAS

     Thou hast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA

     Thou hast sworn it more to me:Then whither goest? say, whither?

Clown

We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: myfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'llnot trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack afterme. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let'shave the first choice. Follow me, girls.Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA


AUTOLYCUS

And you shall pay well for 'em.Follows singing
Will you buy any tape,Or lace for your cape,My dainty duck, my dear-a?Any silk, any thread,Any toys for your head,Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?Come to the pedlar;Money's a medler.That doth utter all men's ware-a.Exit
Re-enter Servant


Servant

Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have madethemselves all men of hair, they call themselvesSaltiers, and they have a dance which the wenchessay is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they arenot in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if itbe not too rough for some that know little butbowling, it will please plentifully.

Shepherd

Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too muchhomely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES

You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's seethese four threes of herdsmen.

Servant

One three of them, by their own report, sir, hathdanced before the king; and not the worst of thethree but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd

Leave your prating: since these good men arepleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant

Why, they stay at door, sir.Exit
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs


POLIXENES

O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.To CAMILLO
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.He's simple and tells much.To FLORIZEL
How now, fair shepherd!Your heart is full of something that does takeYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was youngAnd handed love as you do, I was wontTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'dThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd itTo her acceptance; you have let him goAnd nothing marted with him. If your lassInterpretation should abuse and call thisYour lack of love or bounty, you were straitedFor a reply, at least if you make a careOf happy holding her.

FLORIZEL

Old sir, I knowShe prizes not such trifles as these are:The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'dUp in my heart; which I have given already,But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my lifeBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,As soft as dove's down and as white as it,Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'dsnow that's boltedBy the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES

What follows this?How prettily the young swain seems to washThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:But to your protestation; let me hearWhat you profess.

FLORIZEL

                  Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES

And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL

And he, and moreThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youthThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledgeMore than was ever man's, I would not prize themWithout her love; for her employ them all;Commend them and condemn them to her serviceOr to their own perdition.

POLIXENES

Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO

This shows a sound affection.

Shepherd

But, my daughter,Say you the like to him?

PERDITA

I cannot speakSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut outThe purity of his.

Shepherd

                  Take hands, a bargain!And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:I give my daughter to him, and will makeHer portion equal his.

FLORIZEL

O, that must beI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,I shall have more than you can dream of yet;Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd

Come, your hand;And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES

Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;Have you a father?

FLORIZEL

                  I have: but what of him?

POLIXENES

Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL

                  He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES

Methinks a fatherIs at the nuptial of his son a guestThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,Is not your father grown incapableOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupidWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?Know man from man? dispute his own estate?Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothingBut what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL

No, good sir;He has his health and ampler strength indeedThan most have of his age.

POLIXENES

By my white beard,You offer him, if this be so, a wrongSomething unfilial: reason my sonShould choose himself a wife, but as good reasonThe father, all whose joy is nothing elseBut fair posterity, should hold some counselIn such a business.

FLORIZEL

I yield all this;But for some other reasons, my grave sir,Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaintMy father of this business.

POLIXENES

Let him know't.

FLORIZEL

He shall not.

POLIXENES

                  Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL

No, he must not.

Shepherd

Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieveAt knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL

Come, come, he must not.Mark our contract.

POLIXENES

                  Mark your divorce, young sir,Discovering himself
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too baseTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,I am sorry that by hanging thee I canBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh pieceOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must knowThe royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd

O, my heart!

POLIXENES

I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and madeMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,If I may ever know thou dost but sighThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as neverI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,Though full of our displeasure, yet we free theeFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,That makes himself, but for our honour therein,Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thouThese rural latches to his entrance open,Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,I will devise a death as cruel for theeAs thou art tender to't.Exit


PERDITA

Even here undone!I was not much afeard; for once or twiceI was about to speak and tell him plainly,The selfsame sun that shines upon his courtHides not his visage from our cottage butLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?I told you what would come of this: beseech you,Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO

Why, how now, father!Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd

I cannot speak, nor thinkNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!You have undone a man of fourscore three,That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,To die upon the bed my father died,To lie close by his honest bones: but nowSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay meWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,That knew'st this was the prince,and wouldst adventureTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!If I might die within this hour, I have livedTo die when I desire.Exit


FLORIZEL

Why look you so upon me?I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;More straining on for plucking back, not followingMy leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO

Gracious my lord,You know your father's temper: at this timeHe will allow no speech, which I do guessYou do not purpose to him; and as hardlyWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:Then, till the fury of his highness settle,Come not before him.

FLORIZEL

I not purpose it.I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO

                  Even he, my lord.

PERDITA

How often have I told you 'twould be thus!How often said, my dignity would lastBut till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL

It cannot fail but byThe violation of my faith; and thenLet nature crush the sides o' the earth togetherAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:From my succession wipe me, father; IAm heir to my affection.

CAMILLO

Be advised.

FLORIZEL

I am, and by my fancy: if my reasonWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO

                  This is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL

So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that mayBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees orThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hidesIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oathTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean notTo see him any more,--cast your good counselsUpon his passion; let myself and fortuneTug for the time to come. This you may knowAnd so deliver, I am put to seaWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;And most opportune to our need I haveA vessel rides fast by, but not preparedFor this design. What course I mean to holdShall nothing benefit your knowledge, norConcern me the reporting.

CAMILLO

O my lord!I would your spirit were easier for advice,Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL

Hark, PerditaDrawing her aside
I'll hear you by and by.

CAMILLO

He's irremoveable,Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, ifHis going I could frame to serve my turn,Save him from danger, do him love and honour,Purchase the sight again of dear SiciliaAnd that unhappy king, my master, whomI so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL

Now, good Camillo;I am so fraught with curious business thatI leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO

Sir, I thinkYou have heard of my poor services, i' the loveThat I have borne your father?

FLORIZEL

Very noblyHave you deserved: it is my father's musicTo speak your deeds, not little of his careTo have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMILLO

Well, my lord,If you may please to think I love the kingAnd through him what is nearest to him, which isYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:If your more ponderous and settled projectMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,I'll point you where you shall have such receivingAs shall become your highness; where you mayEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,There's no disjunction to be made, but by--As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,And, with my best endeavours in your absence,Your discontenting father strive to qualifyAnd bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL

How, Camillo,May this, almost a miracle, be done?That I may call thee something more than manAnd after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO

Have you thought onA place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL

Not any yet:But as the unthought-on accident is guiltyTo what we wildly do, so we professOurselves to be the slaves of chance and fliesOf every wind that blows.

CAMILLO

Then list to me:This follows, if you will not change your purposeBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,And there present yourself and your fair princess,For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:She shall be habited as it becomesThe partner of your bed. Methinks I seeLeontes opening his free arms and weepingHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the handsOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the oneHe chides to hell and bids the other growFaster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL

Worthy Camillo,What colour for my visitation shall IHold up before him?

CAMILLO

Sent by the king your fatherTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,The manner of your bearing towards him, withWhat you as from your father shall deliver,Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:The which shall point you forth at every sittingWhat you must say; that he shall not perceiveBut that you have your father's bosom thereAnd speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL

I am bound to you:There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO

A cause more promisingThan a wild dedication of yourselvesTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certainTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,But as you shake off one to take another;Nothing so certain as your anchors, whoDo their best office, if they can but stay youWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you knowProsperity's the very bond of love,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart togetherAffliction alters.

PERDITA

                  One of these is true:I think affliction may subdue the cheek,But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO

Yea, say you so?There shall not at your father's house theseseven yearsBe born another such.

FLORIZEL

My good Camillo,She is as forward of her breeding asShe is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO

I cannot say 'tis pityShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistressTo most that teach.

PERDITA

Your pardon, sir; for thisI'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL

My prettiest Perdita!But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,Preserver of my father, now of me,The medicine of our house, how shall we do?We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

CAMILLO

My lord,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunesDo all lie there: it shall be so my careTo have you royally appointed as ifThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,That you may know you shall not want, one word.They talk aside

AUTOLYCUS

Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, hissworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have soldall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not aribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng whoshould buy first, as if my trinkets had beenhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:by which means I saw whose purse was best inpicture; and what I saw, to my good use Iremembered. My clown, who wants but something tobe a reasonable man, grew so in love with thewenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoestill he had both tune and words; which so drew therest of the herd to me that all their other sensesstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, itwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of apurse; I could have filed keys off that hung inchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in thistime of lethargy I picked and cut most of theirfestival purses; and had not the old man come inwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king'sson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had notleft a purse alive in the whole army.CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward


CAMILLO

Nay, but my letters, by this means being thereSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

Shall satisfy your father.

How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fearnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS

I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO

Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that fromthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we mustmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--andchange garments with this gentleman: though thepennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,there's some boot.

CAMILLO

The swifter speed the better.Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO


AUTOLYCUS

I understand the business, I hear it: to have anopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, isnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisitealso, to smell out work for the other senses. I seethis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.What an exchange had this been without boot! Whata boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods dothis year connive at us, and we may do any thingextempore. The prince himself is about a piece ofiniquity, stealing away from his father with hisclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece ofhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would notdo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;and therein am I constant to my profession.Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:every lane's end, every shop, church, session,hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown

See, see; what a man you are now!There is no other way but to tell the kingshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd

Nay, but hear me.

Clown

Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd

Go to, then.

Clown

She being none of your flesh and blood, your fleshand blood has not offended the king; and so yourflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Showthose things you found about her, those secretthings, all but what she has with her: this beingdone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Shepherd

I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and hisson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,neither to his father nor to me, to go about to makeme the king's brother-in-law.

Clown

Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off youcould have been to him and then your blood had beenthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS

[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!

Shepherd

Well, let us to the king: there is that in thisfardel will make him scratch his beard.

How now, rustics! whither are you bound?

Shepherd

To the palace, an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS

Your affairs there, what, with whom, the conditionof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, yournames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown

We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS

A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have nolying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and theyoften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them forit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; thereforethey do not give us the lie.

Clown

Your worship had like to have given us one, if youhad not taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd

Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seestthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect Inot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thybusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtiercap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluckback thy business there: whereupon I command thee toopen thy affair.

Shepherd

My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS

What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd

I know not, an't like you.

Clown

Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say youhave none.

Shepherd

None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS

How blessed are we that are not simple men!Yet nature might have made me as these are,Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown

This cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd

His garments are rich, but he wearsthem not handsomely.

Clown

He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the pickingon's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS

The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?Wherefore that box?

Shepherd

Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,which none must know but the king; and which heshall know within this hour, if I may come to thespeech of him.

AUTOLYCUS

Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd

Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard anew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,if thou beest capable of things serious, thou mustknow the king is full of grief.

Shepard

So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should havemarried a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS

If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:the curses he shall have, the tortures he shallfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown

Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavyand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane tohim, though removed fifty times, shall all comeunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue aram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come intograce! Some say he shall be stoned; but that deathis too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into asheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown

Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'tlike you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then'nointed over with honey, set on the head of awasp's nest; then stand till he be three quartersand a dram dead; then recovered again withaqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw ashe is, and in the hottest day prognosticationproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, thesun looking with a southward eye upon him, where heis to behold him with flies blown to death. But whattalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseriesare to be smiled at, their offences being socapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plainmen, what you have to the king: being somethinggently considered, I'll bring you where he isaboard, tender your persons to his presence,whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in manbesides the king to effect your suits, here is manshall do it.

Clown

He seems to be of great authority: close with him,give him gold; and though authority be a stubbornbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: showthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd

An't please you, sir, to undertake the business forus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as muchmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS

After I have done what I promised?

Shepherd

Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS

Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown

In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitifulone, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS

O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,he'll be made an example.

Clown

Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and showour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of yourdaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, Iwill give you as much as this old man does when thebusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, yourpawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS

I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;go on the right hand: I will but look upon thehedge and follow you.

Clown

We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd

Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.Exeunt Shepherd and Clown


AUTOLYCUS

If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune wouldnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I amcourted now with a double occasion, gold and a meansto do the prince my master good; which who knows howthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bringthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if hethink it fit to shore them again and that thecomplaint they have to the king concerns himnothing, let him call me rogue for being so farofficious; for I am proof against that title andwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I presentthem: there may be matter in it.Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants


CLEOMENES

Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'dA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid downMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;With them forgive yourself.

LEONTES

Whilst I rememberHer and her virtues, I cannot forgetMy blemishes in them, and so still think ofThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,That heirless it hath made my kingdom andDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er manBred his hopes out of.

PAULINA

True, too true, my lord:If, one by one, you wedded all the world,Or from the all that are took something good,To make a perfect woman, she you kill'dWould be unparallel'd.

LEONTES

I think so. Kill'd!She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest meSorely, to say I did; it is as bitterUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES

                  Not at all, good lady:You might have spoken a thousand things that wouldHave done the time more benefit and gracedYour kindness better.

PAULINA

You are one of thoseWould have him wed again.

DION

If you would not so,You pity not the state, nor the remembranceOf his most sovereign name; consider littleWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,May drop upon his kingdom and devourIncertain lookers on. What were more holyThan to rejoice the former queen is well?What holier than, for royalty's repair,For present comfort and for future good,To bless the bed of majesty againWith a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA

There is none worthy,Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the godsWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;For has not the divine Apollo said,Is't not the tenor of his oracle,That King Leontes shall not have an heirTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,Is all as monstrous to our human reasonAs my Antigonus to break his graveAnd come again to me; who, on my life,Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counselMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,Oppose against their wills.To LEONTES
Care not for issue;The crown will find an heir: great AlexanderLeft his to the worthiest; so his successorWas like to be the best.

LEONTES

Good Paulina,Who hast the memory of Hermione,I know, in honour, O, that ever IHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA

And left themMore rich for what they yielded.

LEONTES

Thou speak'st truth.No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,And better used, would make her sainted spiritAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA

Had she such power,She had just cause.

LEONTES

She had; and would incense meTo murder her I married.

PAULINA

I should so.Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you markHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in'tYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your earsShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'dShould be 'Remember mine.'

LEONTES

Stars, stars,And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;I'll have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA

Will you swearNever to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES

Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA

Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES

You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA

Unless another,As like Hermione as is her picture,Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES

                  Good madam,--

PAULINA

I have done.Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,No remedy, but you will,--give me the officeTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so youngAs was your former; but she shall be suchAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,it should take joyTo see her in your arms.

LEONTES

My true Paulina,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA

ThatShall be when your first queen's again in breath;Never till then.Enter a Gentleman


Gentleman

One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,Son of Polixenes, with his princess, sheThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires accessTo your high presence.

LEONTES

What with him? he comes notLike to his father's greatness: his approach,So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us'Tis not a visitation framed, but forcedBy need and accident. What train?

Gentleman

But few,And those but mean.

LEONTES

His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman

Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA

O Hermione,As every present time doth boast itselfAbove a better gone, so must thy graveGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourselfHave said and writ so, but your writing nowIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verseFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,To say you have seen a better.

Gentleman

Pardon, madam:The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,Would she begin a sect, might quench the zealOf all professors else, make proselytesOf who she but bid follow.

PAULINA

How! not women?

Gentleman

Women will love her, that she is a womanMore worth than any man; men, that she isThe rarest of all women.

LEONTES

Go, Cleomenes;Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strangeExeunt CLEOMENES and others
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA

Had our prince,Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'dWell with this lord: there was not full a monthBetween their births.

LEONTES

Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'stHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,When I shall see this gentleman, thy speechesWill bring me to consider that which mayUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;For she did print your royal father off,Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,Your father's image is so hit in you,His very air, that I should call you brother,As I did him, and speak of something wildlyBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earthMight thus have stood begetting wonder asYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--All mine own folly--the society,Amity too, of your brave father, whom,Though bearing misery, I desire my lifeOnce more to look on him.

FLORIZEL

By his commandHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from himGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,Can send his brother: and, but infirmityWhich waits upon worn times hath something seizedHis wish'd ability, he had himselfThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and hisMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--He bade me say so--more than all the sceptresAnd those that bear them living.

LEONTES

O my brother,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stirAfresh within me, and these thy offices,So rarely kind, are as interpretersOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he tooExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,To greet a man not worth her pains, much lessThe adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL

Good my lord,She came from Libya.

LEONTES

Where the warlike Smalus,That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL

Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughterHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,To execute the charge my father gave meFor visiting your highness: my best trainI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;Who for Bohemia bend, to signifyNot only my success in Libya, sir,But my arrival and my wife's in safetyHere where we are.

LEONTES

                  The blessed godsPurge all infection from our air whilst youDo climate here! You have a holy father,A graceful gentleman; against whose person,So sacred as it is, I have done sin:For which the heavens, taking angry note,Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,As he from heaven merits it, with youWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,Such goodly things as you!Enter a Lord


Lord

Most noble sir,That which I shall report will bear no credit,Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,Bohemia greets you from himself by me;Desires you to attach his son, who has--His dignity and duty both cast off--Fled from his father, from his hopes, and withA shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES

Where's Bohemia? speak.

Lord

Here in your city; I now came from him:I speak amazedly; and it becomesMy marvel and my message. To your courtWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,Of this fair couple, meets he on the wayThe father of this seeming lady andHer brother, having both their country quittedWith this young prince.

FLORIZEL

Camillo has betray'd me;Whose honour and whose honesty till nowEndured all weathers.

Lord

Lay't so to his charge:He's with the king your father.

LEONTES

Who? Camillo?

Lord

Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who nowHas these poor men in question. Never saw IWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;Forswear themselves as often as they speak:Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens themWith divers deaths in death.

PERDITA

O my poor father!The heaven sets spies upon us, will not haveOur contract celebrated.

LEONTES

You are married?

FLORIZEL

We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES

My lord,Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL

She is,When once she is my wife.

LEONTES

That 'once' I see by your good father's speedWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,Most sorry, you have broken from his likingWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorryYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL

Dear, look up:Though Fortune, visible an enemy,Should chase us with my father, power no jotHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,Remember since you owed no more to timeThan I do now: with thought of such affections,Step forth mine advocate; at your requestMy father will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES

Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA

Sir, my liege,Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazesThan what you look on now.

LEONTES

I thought of her,Even in these looks I made.To FLORIZEL
But your petitionIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,I am friend to them and you: upon which errandI now go toward him; therefore follow meAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.Exeunt

SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.

Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman


AUTOLYCUS

Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

First Gentleman

I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the oldshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were allcommanded out of the chamber; only this methought Iheard the shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS

I would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Gentleman

I make a broken delivery of the business; but thechanges I perceived in the king and Camillo werevery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, withstaring on one another, to tear the cases of theireyes; there was speech in their dumbness, languagein their very gesture; they looked as they had heardof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notablepassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisestbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could notsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in theextremity of the one, it must needs be.Enter another Gentleman
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman

Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; theking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad-makerscannot be able to express it.Enter a third Gentleman
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he candeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this newswhich is called true is so like an old tale, thatthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the kingfound his heir?

Third Gentleman

Most true, if ever truth were pregnant bycircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear yousee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantleof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,the letters of Antigonus found with it which theyknow to be his character, the majesty of thecreature in resemblance of the mother, the affectionof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,and many other evidences proclaim her with allcertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you seethe meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman

No.

Third Gentleman

Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld onejoy crown another, so and in such manner that itseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for theirjoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,holding up of hands, with countenances of suchdistraction that they were to be known by garment,not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out ofhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if thatjoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; thenembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he hisdaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the oldshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bittenconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of suchanother encounter, which lames report to follow itand undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman

What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carriedhence the child?

Third Gentleman

Like an old tale still, which will have matter torehearse, though credit be asleep and not an earopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: thisavouches the shepherd's son; who has not only hisinnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but ahandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.

First Gentleman

What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentleman

Wrecked the same instant of their master's death andin the view of the shepherd: so that all theinstruments which aided to expose the child wereeven then lost when it was found. But O, the noblecombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought inPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss ofher husband, another elevated that the oracle wasfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pinher to her heart that she might no more be in dangerof losing.

First Gentleman

The dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third Gentleman

One of the prettiest touches of all and that whichangled for mine eyes, caught the water though notthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen'sdeath, with the manner how she came to't bravelyconfessed and lamented by the king, howattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from onesign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure myheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changedcolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the worldcould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman

Are they returned to the court?

Third Gentleman

No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece manyyears in doing and now newly performed by that rareItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himselfeternity and could put breath into his work, wouldbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is herape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione thatthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope ofanswer: thither with all greediness of affectionare they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman

I thought she had some great matter there in hand;for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, eversince the death of Hermione, visited that removedhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piecethe rejoicing?

First Gentleman

Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.Let's along.Exeunt Gentlemen


AUTOLYCUS

Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,would preferment drop on my head. I brought the oldman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heardthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but heat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,so he then took her to be, who began to be muchsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity ofweather continuing, this mystery remainedundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had Ibeen the finder out of this secret, it would nothave relished among my other discredits.Enter Shepherd and Clown
Here come those I have done good to against my will,and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd

Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons anddaughters will be all gentlemen born.

Clown

You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with methis other day, because I was no gentleman born.See you these clothes? say you see them not andthink me still no gentleman born: you were best saythese robes are not gentlemen born: give me thelie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS

I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown

Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd

And so have I, boy.

Clown

So you have: but I was a gentleman born before myfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, andcalled me brother; and then the two kings called myfather brother; and then the prince my brother andthe princess my sister called my father father; andso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-liketears that ever we shed.

Shepherd

We may live, son, to shed many more.

Clown

Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in sopreposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS

I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all thefaults I have committed to your worship and to giveme your good report to the prince my master.

Shepherd

Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we aregentlemen.

Clown

Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS

Ay, an it like your good worship.

Clown

Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thouart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Shepherd

You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown

Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors andfranklins say it, I'll swear it.

Shepherd

How if it be false, son?

Clown

If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swearit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear tothe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands andthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art notall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt bedrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldstbe a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS

I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown

Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do notwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, notbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kingsand the princes, our kindred, are going to see thequeen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thygood masters.Exeunt

SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.

Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants


LEONTES

O grave and good Paulina, the great comfortThat I have had of thee!

PAULINA

What, sovereign sir,I did not well I meant well. All my servicesYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,With your crown'd brother and these your contractedHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,It is a surplus of your grace, which neverMy life may last to answer.

LEONTES

O Paulina,We honour you with trouble: but we cameTo see the statue of our queen: your galleryHave we pass'd through, not without much contentIn many singularities; but we saw notThat which my daughter came to look upon,The statue of her mother.

PAULINA

As she lived peerless,So her dead likeness, I do well believe,Excels whatever yet you look'd uponOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep itLonely, apart. But here it is: prepareTo see the life as lively mock'd as everStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue
I like your silence, it the more shows offYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,Comes it not something near?

LEONTES

Her natural posture!Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeedThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art sheIn thy not chiding, for she was as tenderAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothingSo aged as this seems.

POLIXENES

O, not by much.

PAULINA

So much the more our carver's excellence;Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes herAs she lived now.

LEONTES

                  As now she might have done,So much to my good comfort, as it isNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,Even with such life of majesty, warm life,As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke meFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,There's magic in thy majesty, which hasMy evils conjured to remembrance andFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,Standing like stone with thee.

PERDITA

And give me leave,And do not say 'tis superstition, thatI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,Dear queen, that ended when I but began,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA

O, patience!The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO

My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,So many summers dry; scarce any joyDid ever so long live; no sorrowBut kill'd itself much sooner.

POLIXENES

Dear my brother,Let him that was the cause of this have powerTo take off so much grief from you as heWill piece up in himself.

PAULINA

Indeed, my lord,If I had thought the sight of my poor imageWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--I'ld not have show'd it.

LEONTES

Do not draw the curtain.

PAULINA

No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancyMay think anon it moves.

LEONTES

Let be, let be.Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--What was he that did make it? See, my lord,Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veinsDid verily bear blood?

POLIXENES

Masterly done:The very life seems warm upon her lip.

LEONTES

The fixture of her eye has motion in't,As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA

I'll draw the curtain:My lord's almost so far transported thatHe'll think anon it lives.

LEONTES

O sweet Paulina,Make me to think so twenty years together!No settled senses of the world can matchThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA

I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: butI could afflict you farther.

LEONTES

Do, Paulina;For this affliction has a taste as sweetAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,There is an air comes from her: what fine chiselCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,For I will kiss her.

PAULINA

Good my lord, forbear:The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your ownWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES

No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA

So long could IStand by, a looker on.

PAULINA

Either forbear,Quit presently the chapel, or resolve youFor more amazement. If you can behold it,I'll make the statue move indeed, descendAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--Which I protest against--I am assistedBy wicked powers.

LEONTES

                  What you can make her do,I am content to look on: what to speak,I am content to hear; for 'tis as easyTo make her speak as move.

PAULINA

It is requiredYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;On: those that think it is unlawful businessI am about, let them depart.

LEONTES

Proceed:No foot shall stir.

PAULINA

Music, awake her; strike!Music
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,Bequeath to death your numbness, for from himDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:HERMIONE comes down
Start not; her actions shall be holy asYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun herUntil you see her die again; for thenYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:When she was young you woo'd her; now in ageIs she become the suitor?

LEONTES

O, she's warm!If this be magic, let it be an artLawful as eating.

POLIXENES

                  She embraces him.

CAMILLO

She hangs about his neck:If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES

Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA

That she is living,Were it but told you, should be hooted atLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneelAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONE

You gods, look downAnd from your sacred vials pour your gracesUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how foundThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,Knowing by Paulina that the oracleGave hope thou wast in being, have preservedMyself to see the issue.

PAULINA

There's time enough for that;Lest they desire upon this push to troubleYour joys with like relation. Go together,You precious winners all; your exultationPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,Will wing me to some wither'd bough and thereMy mate, that's never to be found again,Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES

O, peace, Paulina!Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,As I by thine a wife: this is a match,And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,As I thought, dead, and have in vain said manyA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--For him, I partly know his mind--to find theeAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,And take her by the hand, whose worth and honestyIs richly noted and here justifiedBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,That e'er I put between your holy looksMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,Lead us from hence, where we may leisurelyEach one demand an answer to his partPerform'd in this wide gap of time since firstWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.Exeunt
