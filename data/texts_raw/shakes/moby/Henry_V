Chorus

O for a Muse of fire, that would ascendThe brightest heaven of invention,A kingdom for a stage, princes to actAnd monarchs to behold the swelling scene!Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fireCrouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,The flat unraised spirits that have daredOn this unworthy scaffold to bring forthSo great an object: can this cockpit holdThe vasty fields of France? or may we cramWithin this wooden O the very casquesThat did affright the air at Agincourt?O, pardon! since a crooked figure mayAttest in little place a million;And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,On your imaginary forces work.Suppose within the girdle of these wallsAre now confined two mighty monarchies,Whose high upreared and abutting frontsThe perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;Into a thousand parts divide on man,And make imaginary puissance;Think when we talk of horses, that you see themPrinting their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,Turning the accomplishment of many yearsInto an hour-glass: for the which supply,Admit me Chorus to this history;Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.Exit

SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY


CANTERBURY

My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reignWas like, and had indeed against us pass'd,But that the scambling and unquiet timeDid push it out of farther question.

ELY

But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

CANTERBURY

It must be thought on. If it pass against us,We lose the better half of our possession:For all the temporal lands which men devoutBy testament have given to the churchWould they strip from us; being valued thus:As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;And, to relief of lazars and weak age,Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.A hundred almshouses right well supplied;And to the coffers of the king beside,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.

ELY

This would drink deep.

CANTERBURY

'Twould drink the cup and all.

ELY

But what prevention?

CANTERBURY

The king is full of grace and fair regard.

ELY

And a true lover of the holy church.

CANTERBURY

The courses of his youth promised it not.The breath no sooner left his father's body,But that his wildness, mortified in him,Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very momentConsideration, like an angel, cameAnd whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,Leaving his body as a paradise,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.Never was such a sudden scholar made;Never came reformation in a flood,With such a heady currance, scouring faultsNor never Hydra-headed wilfulnessSo soon did lose his seat and all at onceAs in this king.

ELY

                  We are blessed in the change.

CANTERBURY

Hear him but reason in divinity,And all-admiring with an inward wishYou would desire the king were made a prelate:Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,You would say it hath been all in all his study:List his discourse of war, and you shall hearA fearful battle render'd you in music:Turn him to any cause of policy,The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;So that the art and practic part of lifeMust be the mistress to this theoric:Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,Since his addiction was to courses vain,His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,And never noted in him any study,Any retirement, any sequestrationFrom open haunts and popularity.

ELY

The strawberry grows underneath the nettleAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestNeighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:And so the prince obscured his contemplationUnder the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

CANTERBURY

It must be so; for miracles are ceased;And therefore we must needs admit the meansHow things are perfected.

ELY

But, my good lord,How now for mitigation of this billUrged by the commons? Doth his majestyIncline to it, or no?

CANTERBURY

He seems indifferent,Or rather swaying more upon our partThan cherishing the exhibiters against us;For I have made an offer to his majesty,Upon our spiritual convocationAnd in regard of causes now in hand,Which I have open'd to his grace at large,As touching France, to give a greater sumThan ever at one time the clergy yetDid to his predecessors part withal.

ELY

How did this offer seem received, my lord?

CANTERBURY

With good acceptance of his majesty;Save that there was not time enough to hear,As I perceived his grace would fain have done,The severals and unhidden passagesOf his true titles to some certain dukedomsAnd generally to the crown and seat of FranceDerived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

ELY

What was the impediment that broke this off?

CANTERBURY

The French ambassador upon that instantCraved audience; and the hour, I think, is comeTo give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

ELY

It is.

CANTERBURY

Then go we in, to know his embassy;Which I could with a ready guess declare,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

ELY

I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.

Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants


KING HENRY V

Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

EXETER

Not here in presence.

KING HENRY V

Send for him, good uncle.

WESTMORELAND

Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?

KING HENRY V

Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,Before we hear him, of some things of weightThat task our thoughts, concerning us and France.Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY


CANTERBURY

God and his angels guard your sacred throneAnd make you long become it!

KING HENRY V

Sure, we thank you.My learned lord, we pray you to proceedAnd justly and religiously unfoldWhy the law Salique that they have in FranceOr should, or should not, bar us in our claim:And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,Or nicely charge your understanding soulWith opening titles miscreate, whose rightSuits not in native colours with the truth;For God doth know how many now in healthShall drop their blood in approbationOf what your reverence shall incite us to.Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;For never two such kingdoms did contendWithout much fall of blood; whose guiltless dropsAre every one a woe, a sore complaint'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swordsThat make such waste in brief mortality.Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;For we will hear, note and believe in heartThat what you speak is in your conscience wash'dAs pure as sin with baptism.

CANTERBURY

Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,That owe yourselves, your lives and servicesTo this imperial throne. There is no barTo make against your highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:''No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'Which Salique land the French unjustly glozeTo be the realm of France, and PharamondThe founder of this law and female bar.Yet their own authors faithfully affirmThat the land Salique is in Germany,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,There left behind and settled certain French;Who, holding in disdain the German womenFor some dishonest manners of their life,Establish'd then this law; to wit, no femaleShould be inheritrix in Salique land:Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.Then doth it well appear that Salique lawWas not devised for the realm of France:Nor did the French possess the Salique landUntil four hundred one and twenty yearsAfter defunction of King Pharamond,Idly supposed the founder of this law;Who died within the year of our redemptionFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the GreatSubdued the Saxons, and did seat the FrenchBeyond the river Sala, in the yearEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,Did, as heir general, being descendedOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,Make claim and title to the crown of France.Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crownOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir maleOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,To find his title with some shows of truth,'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,Daughter to Charlemain, who was the sonTo Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the sonOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,Could not keep quiet in his conscience,Wearing the crown of France, till satisfiedThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:By the which marriage the line of Charles the GreatWas re-united to the crown of France.So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,King Lewis his satisfaction, all appearTo hold in right and title of the female:So do the kings of France unto this day;Howbeit they would hold up this Salique lawTo bar your highness claiming from the female,And rather choose to hide them in a netThan amply to imbar their crooked titlesUsurp'd from you and your progenitors.

KING HENRY V

May I with right and conscience make this claim?

CANTERBURY

The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!For in the book of Numbers is it writ,When the man dies, let the inheritanceDescend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;Look back into your mighty ancestors:Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,Making defeat on the full power of France,Whiles his most mighty father on a hillStood smiling to behold his lion's whelpForage in blood of French nobility.O noble English. that could entertainWith half their forces the full Pride of FranceAnd let another half stand laughing by,All out of work and cold for action!

ELY

Awake remembrance of these valiant deadAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats:You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;The blood and courage that renowned themRuns in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liegeIs in the very May-morn of his youth,Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

EXETER

Your brother kings and monarchs of the earthDo all expect that you should rouse yourself,As did the former lions of your blood.

WESTMORELAND

They know your grace hath cause and means and might;So hath your highness; never king of EnglandHad nobles richer and more loyal subjects,Whose hearts have left their bodies here in EnglandAnd lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.

CANTERBURY

O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,With blood and sword and fire to win your right;In aid whereof we of the spiritualtyWill raise your highness such a mighty sumAs never did the clergy at one timeBring in to any of your ancestors.

KING HENRY V

We must not only arm to invade the French,But lay down our proportions to defendAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon usWith all advantages.

CANTERBURY

They of those marches, gracious sovereign,Shall be a wall sufficient to defendOur inland from the pilfering borderers.

KING HENRY V

We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,But fear the main intendment of the Scot,Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;For you shall read that my great-grandfatherNever went with his forces into FranceBut that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdomCame pouring, like the tide into a breach,With ample and brim fulness of his force,Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;That England, being empty of defence,Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.

CANTERBURY

She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;For hear her but exampled by herself:When all her chivalry hath been in FranceAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles,She hath herself not only well defendedBut taken and impounded as a strayThe King of Scots; whom she did send to France,To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kingsAnd make her chronicle as rich with praiseAs is the ooze and bottom of the seaWith sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.

WESTMORELAND

But there's a saying very old and true,'If that you will France win,Then with Scotland first begin:'For once the eagle England being in prey,To her unguarded nest the weasel ScotComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,To tear and havoc more than she can eat.

EXETER

It follows then the cat must stay at home:Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,The advised head defends itself at home;For government, though high and low and lower,Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,Congreeing in a full and natural close,Like music.

CANTERBURY

          Therefore doth heaven divideThe state of man in divers functions,Setting endeavour in continual motion;To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,Creatures that by a rule in nature teachThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.They have a king and officers of sorts;Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,Which pillage they with merry march bring homeTo the tent-royal of their emperor;Who, busied in his majesty, surveysThe singing masons building roofs of gold,The civil citizens kneading up the honey,The poor mechanic porters crowding inTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,Delivering o'er to executors paleThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,That many things, having full referenceTo one consent, may work contrariously:As many arrows, loosed several ways,Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;As many lines close in the dial's centre;So may a thousand actions, once afoot.End in one purpose, and be all well borneWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.Divide your happy England into four;Whereof take you one quarter into France,And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.If we, with thrice such powers left at home,Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,Let us be worried and our nation loseThe name of hardiness and policy.

KING HENRY V

Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.Exeunt some Attendants
Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,And yours, the noble sinews of our power,France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,Ruling in large and ample emperyO'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,Tombless, with no remembrance over them:Either our history shall with full mouthSpeak freely of our acts, or else our grave,Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.Enter Ambassadors of France
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasureOf our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hearYour greeting is from him, not from the king.

First Ambassador

May't please your majesty to give us leaveFreely to render what we have in charge;Or shall we sparingly show you far offThe Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

KING HENRY V

We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;Unto whose grace our passion is as subjectAs are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainnessTell us the Dauphin's mind.

First Ambassador

Thus, then, in few.Your highness, lately sending into France,Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the rightOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.In answer of which claim, the prince our masterSays that you savour too much of your youth,And bids you be advised there's nought in FranceThat can be with a nimble galliard won;You cannot revel into dukedoms there.He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,Desires you let the dukedoms that you claimHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.

KING HENRY V

What treasure, uncle?

EXETER

Tennis-balls, my liege.

KING HENRY V

We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;His present and your pains we thank you for:When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,We will, in France, by God's grace, play a setShall strike his father's crown into the hazard.Tell him he hath made a match with such a wranglerThat all the courts of France will be disturb'dWith chaces. And we understand him well,How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,Not measuring what use we made of them.We never valued this poor seat of England;And therefore, living hence, did give ourselfTo barbarous licence; as 'tis ever commonThat men are merriest when they are from home.But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,Be like a king and show my sail of greatnessWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:For that I have laid by my majestyAnd plodded like a man for working-days,But I will rise there with so full a gloryThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.And tell the pleasant prince this mock of hisHath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soulShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeanceThat shall fly with them: for many a thousand widowsShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.But this lies all within the will of God,To whom I do appeal; and in whose nameTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forthMy rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.So get you hence in peace; and tell the DauphinHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.Exeunt Ambassadors


EXETER

This was a merry message.

KING HENRY V

We hope to make the sender blush at it.Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hourThat may give furtherance to our expedition;For we have now no thought in us but France,Save those to God, that run before our business.Therefore let our proportions for these warsBe soon collected and all things thought uponThat may with reasonable swiftness addMore feathers to our wings; for, God before,We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.Therefore let every man now task his thought,That this fair action may on foot be brought.Exeunt.

Chorus

Now all the youth of England are on fire,And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thoughtReigns solely in the breast of every man:They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,Following the mirror of all Christian kings,With winged heels, as English Mercuries.For now sits Expectation in the air,And hides a sword from hilts unto the pointWith crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,Promised to Harry and his followers.The French, advised by good intelligenceOf this most dreadful preparation,Shake in their fear and with pale policySeek to divert the English purposes.O England! model to thy inward greatness,Like little body with a mighty heart,What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,Were all thy children kind and natural!But see thy fault! France hath in thee found outA nest of hollow bosoms, which he fillsWith treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;And by their hands this grace of kings must die,If hell and treason hold their promises,Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.Linger your patience on; and we'll digestThe abuse of distance; force a play:The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;The king is set from London; and the sceneIs now transported, gentles, to Southampton;There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:And thence to France shall we convey you safe,And bring you back, charming the narrow seasTo give you gentle pass; for, if we may,We'll not offend one stomach with our play.But, till the king come forth, and not till then,Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.Exit

NYM

For my part, I care not: I say little; but whentime shall serve, there shall be smiles; but thatshall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I willwink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; butwhat though? it will toast cheese, and it willendure cold as another man's sword will: andthere's an end.

BARDOLPH

I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; andwe'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let itbe so, good Corporal Nym.

NYM

Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's thecertain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, Iwill do as I may: that is my rest, that is therendezvous of it.

BARDOLPH

It is certain, corporal, that he is married to NellQuickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for youwere troth-plight to her.

NYM

I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men maysleep, and they may have their throats about them atthat time; and some say knives have edges. It mustbe as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yetshe will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, Icannot tell.Enter PISTOL and Hostess


BARDOLPH

Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: goodcorporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

PISTOL

Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.

NYM

Will you shog off? I would have you solus.

PISTOL

'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,And flashing fire will follow.

NYM

I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have anhumour to knock you indifferently well. If you growfoul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with myrapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walkoff, I would prick your guts a little, in goodterms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.

PISTOL

O braggart vile and damned furious wight!The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;Therefore exhale.

Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes thefirst stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.Draws

EXETER

They shall be apprehended by and by.

WESTMORELAND

How smooth and even they do bear themselves!As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

BEDFORD

The king hath note of all that they intend,By interception which they dream not of.

Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,That he should, for a foreign purse, so sellHis sovereign's life to death and treachery.Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants


KING HENRY V

Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:Think you not that the powers we bear with usWill cut their passage through the force of France,Doing the execution and the actFor which we have in head assembled them?

SCROOP

No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

KING HENRY V

I doubt not that; since we are well persuadedWe carry not a heart with us from henceThat grows not in a fair consent with ours,Nor leave not one behind that doth not wishSuccess and conquest to attend on us.

CAMBRIDGE

Never was monarch better fear'd and lovedThan is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subjectThat sits in heart-grief and uneasinessUnder the sweet shade of your government.

GREY

True: those that were your father's enemiesHave steep'd their galls in honey and do serve youWith hearts create of duty and of zeal.

KING HENRY V

We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;And shall forget the office of our hand,Sooner than quittance of desert and meritAccording to the weight and worthiness.

SCROOP

So service shall with steeled sinews toil,And labour shall refresh itself with hope,To do your grace incessant services.

KING HENRY V

We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,Enlarge the man committed yesterday,That rail'd against our person: we considerit was excess of wine that set him on;And on his more advice we pardon him.

SCROOP

That's mercy, but too much security:Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest exampleBreed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

KING HENRY V

O, let us yet be merciful.

CAMBRIDGE

So may your highness, and yet punish too.

GREY

Sir,You show great mercy, if you give him life,After the taste of much correction.

KING HENRY V

Alas, your too much love and care of meAre heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!If little faults, proceeding on distemper,Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eyeWhen capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear careAnd tender preservation of our person,Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:Who are the late commissioners?

CAMBRIDGE

I one, my lord:Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.

SCROOP

So did you me, my liege.

GREY

And I, my royal sovereign.

KING HENRY V

Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!What see you in those papers that you loseSo much complexion? Look ye, how they change!Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you thereThat hath so cowarded and chased your bloodOut of appearance?

CAMBRIDGE

                  I do confess my fault;And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

GREY

SCROOP

To which we all appeal.

KING HENRY V

The mercy that was quick in us but late,By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.See you, my princes, and my noble peers,These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,You know how apt our love was to accordTo furnish him with all appertinentsBelonging to his honour; and this manHath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,And sworn unto the practises of France,To kill us here in Hampton: to the whichThis knight, no less for bounty bound to usThan Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,May it be possible, that foreign hireCould out of thee extract one spark of evilThat might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,That, though the truth of it stands off as grossAs black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.Treason and murder ever kept together,As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,Working so grossly in a natural cause,That admiration did not whoop at them:But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring inWonder to wait on treason and on murder:And whatsoever cunning fiend it wasThat wrought upon thee so preposterouslyHath got the voice in hell for excellence:All other devils that suggest by treasonsDo botch and bungle up damnationWith patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'dFrom glistering semblances of piety;But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thusShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,He might return to vasty Tartar back,And tell the legions 'I can never winA soul so easy as that Englishman's.'O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infectedThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,Not working with the eye without the ear,And but in purged judgment trusting neither?Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,To mark the full-fraught man and best induedWith some suspicion. I will weep for thee;For this revolt of thine, methinks, is likeAnother fall of man. Their faults are open:Arrest them to the answer of the law;And God acquit them of their practises!

EXETER

   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofRichard Earl of Cambridge.I arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofHenry Lord Scroop of Masham.I arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofThomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

SCROOP

Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;And I repent my fault more than my death;Which I beseech your highness to forgive,Although my body pay the price of it.

CAMBRIDGE

For me, the gold of France did not seduce;Although I did admit it as a motiveThe sooner to effect what I intended:But God be thanked for prevention;Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,Beseeching God and you to pardon me.

GREY

Never did faithful subject more rejoiceAt the discovery of most dangerous treasonThan I do at this hour joy o'er myself.Prevented from a damned enterprise:My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

KING HENRY V

God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.You have conspired against our royal person,Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffersReceived the golden earnest of our death;Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,His princes and his peers to servitude,His subjects to oppression and contemptAnd his whole kingdom into desolation.Touching our person seek we no revenge;But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,Whose ruin you have sought, that to her lawsWe do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,Poor miserable wretches, to your death:The taste whereof, God of his mercy giveYou patience to endure, and true repentanceOf all your dear offences! Bear them hence.Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded
Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereofShall be to you, as us, like glorious.We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,Since God so graciously hath brought to lightThis dangerous treason lurking in our wayTo hinder our beginnings. We doubt not nowBut every rub is smoothed on our way.Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliverOur puissance into the hand of God,Putting it straight in expedition.Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:No king of England, if not king of France.Exeunt

Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy


Hostess

Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.

PISTOL

No; for my manly heart doth yearn.Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,And we must yearn therefore.

BARDOLPH

Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either inheaven or in hell!

Hostess

Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur'sbosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' madea finer end and went away an it had been anychristom child; a' parted even just between twelveand one, even at the turning o' the tide: for afterI saw him fumble with the sheets and play withflowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knewthere was but one way; for his nose was as sharp asa pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' goodcheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three orfour times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'should not think of God; I hoped there was no needto trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. Soa' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put myhand into the bed and felt them, and they were ascold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, andthey were as cold as any stone, and so upward andupward, and all was as cold as any stone.

NYM

They say he cried out of sack.

Hostess

Ay, that a' did.

BARDOLPH

And of women.

Hostess

Nay, that a' did not.

Boy

Yes, that a' did; and said they were devilsincarnate.

Hostess

A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour henever liked.

Boy

A' said once, the devil would have him about women.

Hostess

A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but thenhe was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

Boy

Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick uponBardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soulburning in hell-fire?

BARDOLPH

Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:that's all the riches I got in his service.

NYM

Shall we shog? the king will be gone fromSouthampton.

PISTOL

Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.Look to my chattels and my movables:Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'Trust none;For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.Go, clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

Boy

And that's but unwholesome food they say.

PISTOL

Touch her soft mouth, and march.

BARDOLPH

Farewell, hostess.Kissing her


NYM

I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.

PISTOL

Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.

Hostess

Farewell; adieu.Exeunt

SCENE IV. France. The KING'S palace.

Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others


KING OF FRANCE

Thus comes the English with full power upon us;And more than carefully it us concernsTo answer royally in our defences.Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,To line and new repair our towns of warWith men of courage and with means defendant;For England his approaches makes as fierceAs waters to the sucking of a gulf.It fits us then to be as providentAs fear may teach us out of late examplesLeft by the fatal and neglected EnglishUpon our fields.

DAUPHIN

                  My most redoubted father,It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,But that defences, musters, preparations,Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,As were a war in expectation.Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forthTo view the sick and feeble parts of France:And let us do it with no show of fear;No, with no more than if we heard that EnglandWere busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,Her sceptre so fantastically borneBy a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,That fear attends her not.

Constable

O peace, Prince Dauphin!You are too much mistaken in this king:Question your grace the late ambassadors,With what great state he heard their embassy,How well supplied with noble counsellors,How modest in exception, and withalHow terrible in constant resolution,And you shall find his vanities forespentWere but the outside of the Roman Brutus,Covering discretion with a coat of folly;As gardeners do with ordure hide those rootsThat shall first spring and be most delicate.

DAUPHIN

Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;But though we think it so, it is no matter:In cases of defence 'tis best to weighThe enemy more mighty than he seems:So the proportions of defence are fill'd;Which of a weak or niggardly projectionDoth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scantingA little cloth.

KING OF FRANCE

                  Think we King Harry strong;And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;And he is bred out of that bloody strainThat haunted us in our familiar paths:Witness our too much memorable shameWhen Cressy battle fatally was struck,And all our princes captiv'd by the handOf that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,Mangle the work of nature and defaceThe patterns that by God and by French fathersHad twenty years been made. This is a stemOf that victorious stock; and let us fearThe native mightiness and fate of him.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

Ambassadors from Harry King of EnglandDo crave admittance to your majesty.

KING OF FRANCE

We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords
You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.

DAUPHIN

Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogsMost spend their mouths when what they seem to threatenRuns far before them. Good my sovereign,Take up the English short, and let them knowOf what a monarchy you are the head:Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sinAs self-neglecting.Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train


KING OF FRANCE

From our brother England?

EXETER

From him; and thus he greets your majesty.He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,That you divest yourself, and lay apartThe borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,By law of nature and of nations, 'longTo him and to his heirs; namely, the crownAnd all wide-stretched honours that pertainBy custom and the ordinance of timesUnto the crown of France. That you may know'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,He sends you this most memorable line,In every branch truly demonstrative;Willing to overlook this pedigree:And when you find him evenly derivedFrom his most famed of famous ancestors,Edward the Third, he bids you then resignYour crown and kingdom, indirectly heldFrom him the native and true challenger.

KING OF FRANCE

Or else what follows?

EXETER

Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crownEven in your hearts, there will he rake for it:Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,That, if requiring fail, he will compel;And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,Deliver up the crown, and to take mercyOn the poor souls for whom this hungry warOpens his vasty jaws; and on your headTurning the widows' tears, the orphans' criesThe dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.This is his claim, his threatening and my message;Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

KING OF FRANCE

For us, we will consider of this further:To-morrow shall you bear our full intentBack to our brother England.

DAUPHIN

For the Dauphin,I stand here for him: what to him from England?

EXETER

Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,And any thing that may not misbecomeThe mighty sender, doth he prize you at.Thus says my king; an' if your father's highnessDo not, in grant of all demands at large,Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,That caves and womby vaultages of FranceShall chide your trespass and return your mockIn second accent of his ordnance.

DAUPHIN

Say, if my father render fair return,It is against my will; for I desireNothing but odds with England: to that end,As matching to his youth and vanity,I did present him with the Paris balls.

EXETER

He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:And, be assured, you'll find a difference,As we his subjects have in wonder found,Between the promise of his greener daysAnd these he masters now: now he weighs timeEven to the utmost grain: that you shall readIn your own losses, if he stay in France.

KING OF FRANCE

To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.

EXETER

Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our kingCome here himself to question our delay;For he is footed in this land already.

KING OF FRANCE

You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:A night is but small breath and little pauseTo answer matters of this consequence.Flourish. Exeunt

PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus


Chorus

Thus with imagined wing our swift scene fliesIn motion of no less celerityThan that of thought. Suppose that you have seenThe well-appointed king at Hampton pierEmbark his royalty; and his brave fleetWith silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:Play with your fancies, and in them beholdUpon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;Hear the shrill whistle which doth order giveTo sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but thinkYou stand upon the ravage and beholdA city on the inconstant billows dancing;For so appears this fleet majestical,Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,And leave your England, as dead midnight still,Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'dWith one appearing hair, that will not followThese cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;Behold the ordnance on their carriages,With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;Tells Harry that the king doth offer himKatharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.The offer likes not: and the nimble gunnerWith linstock now the devilish cannon touches,Alarum, and chambers go off
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,And eke out our performance with your mind.Exit

KING HENRY V

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;Or close the wall up with our English dead.In peace there's nothing so becomes a manAs modest stillness and humility:But when the blast of war blows in our ears,Then imitate the action of the tiger;Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;Let pry through the portage of the headLike the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm itAs fearfully as doth a galled rockO'erhang and jutty his confounded base,Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,Hold hard the breath and bend up every spiritTo his full height. On, on, you noblest English.Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,Have in these parts from morn till even foughtAnd sheathed their swords for lack of argument:Dishonour not your mothers; now attestThat those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.Be copy now to men of grosser blood,And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,Whose limbs were made in England, show us hereThe mettle of your pasture; let us swearThat you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;For there is none of you so mean and base,That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:Follow your spirit, and upon this chargeCry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off

NYM

Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:the humour of it is too hot, that is the veryplain-song of it.

PISTOL

The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;And sword and shield,In bloody field,Doth win immortal fame.

Boy

Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would giveall my fame for a pot of ale and safety.

PISTOL

And I:If wishes would prevail with me,My purpose should not fail with me,But thither would I hie.

These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.Exeunt all but Boy


Boy

As young as I am, I have observed these threeswashers. I am boy to them all three: but all theythree, though they would serve me, could not be manto me; for indeed three such antics do not amount toa man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered andred-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, butfights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongueand a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breakswords, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hathheard that men of few words are the best men; andtherefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'should be thought a coward: but his few bad wordsare matched with as few good deeds; for a' neverbroke any man's head but his own, and that wasagainst a post when he was drunk. They will stealany thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole alute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it forthree half pence. Nym and Bardolph are swornbrothers in filching, and in Calais they stole afire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service themen would carry coals. They would have me asfamiliar with men's pockets as their gloves or theirhandkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,if I should take from another's pocket to put intomine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. Imust leave them, and seek some better service:their villany goes against my weak stomach, andtherefore I must cast it up.Exit
Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following


GOWER

Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to themines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.

FLUELLEN

To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so goodto come to the mines; for, look you, the mines isnot according to the disciplines of the war: theconcavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, lookyou, is digt himself four yard under thecountermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough upall, if there is not better directions.

GOWER

The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of thesiege is given, is altogether directed by anIrishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

FLUELLEN

It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

GOWER

I think it be.

By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I willverify as much in his beard: be has no moredirections in the true disciplines of the wars, lookyou, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY


GOWER

Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

FLUELLEN

Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,that is certain; and of great expedition andknowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particularknowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he willmaintain his argument as well as any military man inthe world, in the disciplines of the pristine warsof the Romans.

JAMY

I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.

FLUELLEN

God-den to your worship, good Captain James.

GOWER

How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit themines? have the pioneers given o'er?

MACMORRIS

By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish giveover, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, Iswear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, soChrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!

FLUELLEN

Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will youvoutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,as partly touching or concerning the disciplines ofthe war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,look you, and friendly communication; partly tosatisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,look you, of my mind, as touching the direction ofthe military discipline; that is the point.

JAMY

It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pickoccasion; that sall I, marry.

MACMORRIS

It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: theday is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and theking, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. Thetown is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to thebreach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame tostand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there isthroats to be cut, and works to be done; and thereish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!

JAMY

By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselvesto slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad fullfain hear some question 'tween you tway.

FLUELLEN

Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under yourcorrection, there is not many of your nation--

MACMORRIS

Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ishmy nation? Who talks of my nation?

FLUELLEN

Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than ismeant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall thinkyou do not use me with that affability as indiscretion you ought to use me, look you: being asgood a man as yourself, both in the disciplines ofwar, and in the derivation of my birth, and inother particularities.

MACMORRIS

I do not know you so good a man as myself: soChrish save me, I will cut off your head.

GOWER

Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.

JAMY

A! that's a foul fault.A parley sounded


GOWER

KING HENRY V

How yet resolves the governor of the town?This is the latest parle we will admit;Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;Or like to men proud of destructionDefy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,If I begin the battery once again,I will not leave the half-achieved HarfleurTill in her ashes she lie buried.The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,In liberty of bloody hand shall rangeWith conscience wide as hell, mowing like grassYour fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.What is it then to me, if impious war,Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell featsEnlink'd to waste and desolation?What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,If your pure maidens fall into the handOf hot and forcing violation?What rein can hold licentious wickednessWhen down the hill he holds his fierce career?We may as bootless spend our vain commandUpon the enraged soldiers in their spoilAs send precepts to the leviathanTo come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,Take pity of your town and of your people,Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of graceO'erblows the filthy and contagious cloudsOf heady murder, spoil and villany.If not, why, in a moment look to seeThe blind and bloody soldier with foul handDefile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;Your fathers taken by the silver beards,And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confusedDo break the clouds, as did the wives of JewryAt Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

GOVERNOR

Our expectation hath this day an end:The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,Returns us that his powers are yet not readyTo raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;For we no longer are defensible.

KING HENRY V

Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,The winter coming on and sickness growingUpon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;To-morrow for the march are we addrest.Flourish.

KING OF FRANCE

'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

Constable

And if he be not fought withal, my lord,Let us not live in France; let us quit allAnd give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

DAUPHIN

O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,The emptying of our fathers' luxury,Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,And overlook their grafters?

BOURBON

Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!Mort de ma vie! if they march alongUnfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,To buy a slobbery and a dirty farmIn that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

Constable

Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,Let us not hang like roping iciclesUpon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty peopleSweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!Poor we may call them in their native lords.

DAUPHIN

By faith and honour,Our madams mock at us, and plainly sayOur mettle is bred out and they will giveTheir bodies to the lust of English youthTo new-store France with bastard warriors.

BOURBON

They bid us to the English dancing-schools,And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;Saying our grace is only in our heels,And that we are most lofty runaways.

KING OF FRANCE

Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edgedMore sharper than your swords, hie to the field:Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,For your great seats now quit you of great shames.Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our landWith pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:Rush on his host, as doth the melted snowUpon the valleys, whose low vassal seatThe Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:Go down upon him, you have power enough,And in a captive chariot into RouenBring him our prisoner.

Constable

This becomes the great.Sorry am I his numbers are so few,His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,For I am sure, when he shall see our army,He'll drop his heart into the sink of fearAnd for achievement offer us his ransom.

KING OF FRANCE

Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.And let him say to England that we sendTo know what willing ransom he will give.Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

DAUPHIN

Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

KING OF FRANCE

Be patient, for you shall remain with us.Now forth, lord constable and princes all,And quickly bring us word of England's fall.Exeunt

SCENE VI. The English camp in Picardy.

Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting


GOWER

How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?

FLUELLEN

I assure you, there is very excellent servicescommitted at the bridge.

GOWER

Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

FLUELLEN

The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and myheart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, andmy uttermost power: he is not-God be praised andblessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps thebridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.There is an aunchient lieutenant there at thepridge, I think in my very conscience he is asvaliant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of noestimation in the world; but did see him do asgallant service.

GOWER

What do you call him?

FLUELLEN

He is called Aunchient Pistol.

GOWER

I know him not.Enter PISTOL


FLUELLEN

Here is the man.

PISTOL

Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

FLUELLEN

Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love athis hands.

PISTOL

Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,That goddess blind,That stands upon the rolling restless stone--

FLUELLEN

By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune ispainted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, tosignify to you that Fortune is blind; and she ispainted also with a wheel, to signify to you, whichis the moral of it, that she is turning, andinconstant, and mutability, and variation: and herfoot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,the poet makes a most excellent description of it:Fortune is an excellent moral.

PISTOL

Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:A damned death!Let gallows gape for dog; let man go freeAnd let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:But Exeter hath given the doom of deathFor pax of little price.Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cutWith edge of penny cord and vile reproach:Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

FLUELLEN

Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.

PISTOL

Why then, rejoice therefore.

FLUELLEN

Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoiceat: for if, look you, he were my brother, I woulddesire the duke to use his good pleasure, and puthim to execution; for discipline ought to be used.

PISTOL

Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!

FLUELLEN

It is well.

PISTOL

The fig of Spain!Exit


FLUELLEN

Very good.

GOWER

Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; Iremember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.

FLUELLEN

I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at thebridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But itis very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,I warrant you, when time is serve.

GOWER

Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and thengoes to the wars, to grace himself at his returninto London under the form of a soldier. And suchfellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:and they will learn you by rote where services weredone; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who wasshot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and whata beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit ofthe camp will do among foaming bottles andale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. Butyou must learn to know such slanders of the age, orelse you may be marvellously mistook.

FLUELLEN

I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he isnot the man that he would gladly make show to theworld he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I willtell him my mind.Drum heard
Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak withhim from the pridge.Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers
God pless your majesty!

KING HENRY V

How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?

FLUELLEN

Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter hasvery gallantly maintained the pridge: the French isgone off, look you; and there is gallant and mostprave passages; marry, th' athversary was havepossession of the pridge; but he is enforced toretire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of thepridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is aprave man.

KING HENRY V

What men have you lost, Fluellen?

FLUELLEN

The perdition of th' athversary hath been verygreat, reasonable great: marry, for my part, Ithink the duke hath lost never a man, but one thatis like to be executed for robbing a church, oneBardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face isall bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is likea coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;but his nose is executed and his fire's out.

KING HENRY V

We would have all such offenders so cut off: and wegive express charge, that in our marches through thecountry, there be nothing compelled from thevillages, nothing taken but paid for, none of theFrench upbraided or abused in disdainful language;for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, thegentler gamester is the soonest winner.Tucket. Enter MONTJOY


MONTJOY

You know me by my habit.

KING HENRY V

Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?

MONTJOY

My master's mind.

KING HENRY V

Unfold it.

MONTJOY

Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantageis a better soldier than rashness. Tell him wecould have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that wethought not good to bruise an injury till it werefull ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voiceis imperial: England shall repent his folly, seehis weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid himtherefore consider of his ransom; which mustproportion the losses we have borne, the subjects wehave lost, the disgrace we have digested; which inweight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for theeffusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom toofaint a number; and for our disgrace, his ownperson, kneeling at our feet, but a weak andworthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: andtell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed hisfollowers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So farmy king and master; so much my office.

KING HENRY V

What is thy name? I know thy quality.

MONTJOY

Montjoy.

KING HENRY V

Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.And tell thy king I do not seek him now;But could be willing to march on to CalaisWithout impeachment: for, to say the sooth,Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so muchUnto an enemy of craft and vantage,My people are with sickness much enfeebled,My numbers lessened, and those few I haveAlmost no better than so many French;Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,I thought upon one pair of English legsDid march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,That I do brag thus! This your air of FranceHath blown that vice in me: I must repent.Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,My army but a weak and sickly guard;Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,Though France himself and such another neighbourStand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.Go bid thy master well advise himself:If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,We shall your tawny ground with your red bloodDiscolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.The sum of all our answer is but this:We would not seek a battle, as we are;Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:So tell your master.

MONTJOY

I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.Exit


GLOUCESTER

I hope they will not come upon us now.

KING HENRY V

We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,And on to-morrow, bid them march away.Exeunt

SCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt:

Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others


Constable

Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!

ORLEANS

You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.

Constable

It is the best horse of Europe.

ORLEANS

Will it never be morning?

DAUPHIN

My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, youtalk of horse and armour?

ORLEANS

You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.

DAUPHIN

What a long night is this! I will not change myhorse with any that treads but on four pasterns.Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if hisentrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, Isoar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earthsings when he touches it; the basest horn of hishoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

ORLEANS

He's of the colour of the nutmeg.

DAUPHIN

And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast forPerseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dullelements of earth and water never appear in him, butonly in Patient stillness while his rider mountshim: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades youmay call beasts.

Constable

Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

DAUPHIN

It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like thebidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.

ORLEANS

No more, cousin.

DAUPHIN

Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from therising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, varydeserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme asfluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquenttongues, and my horse is argument for them all:'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and fora sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for theworld, familiar to us and unknown to lay aparttheir particular functions and wonder at him. Ionce writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:'Wonder of nature,'--

ORLEANS

I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.

DAUPHIN

Then did they imitate that which I composed to mycourser, for my horse is my mistress.

ORLEANS

Your mistress bears well.

DAUPHIN

Me well; which is the prescript praise andperfection of a good and particular mistress.

Constable

Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdlyshook your back.

DAUPHIN

So perhaps did yours.

Constable

Mine was not bridled.

DAUPHIN

O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and inyour straight strossers.

Constable

You have good judgment in horsemanship.

DAUPHIN

Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ridenot warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather havemy horse to my mistress.

Constable

I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

DAUPHIN

I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.

Constable

I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sowto my mistress.

DAUPHIN

'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, etla truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.

Constable

Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or anysuch proverb so little kin to the purpose.

RAMBURES

My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tentto-night, are those stars or suns upon it?

Constable

Stars, my lord.

DAUPHIN

Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.

Constable

And yet my sky shall not want.

DAUPHIN

That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and'twere more honour some were away.

Constable

Even as your horse bears your praises; who wouldtrot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.

DAUPHIN

Would I were able to load him with his desert! Willit never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, andmy way shall be paved with English faces.

Constable

I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out ofmy way: but I would it were morning; for I wouldfain be about the ears of the English.

RAMBURES

Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?

Constable

You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.

DAUPHIN

'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.Exit


ORLEANS

The Dauphin longs for morning.

RAMBURES

He longs to eat the English.

Constable

I think he will eat all he kills.

ORLEANS

By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

Constable

Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

ORLEANS

He is simply the most active gentleman of France.

Constable

Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

ORLEANS

He never did harm, that I heard of.

Constable

Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.

ORLEANS

I know him to be valiant.

Constable

I was told that  by one that knows him better thanyou.

ORLEANS

What's he?

Constable

Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he carednot who knew it

ORLEANS

He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.

Constable

By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw itbut his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when itappears, it will bate.

ORLEANS

Ill will never said well.

Constable

I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'

ORLEANS

And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'

Constable

Well placed: there stands your friend for thedevil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'Apox of the devil.'

ORLEANS

You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'Afool's bolt is soon shot.'

Constable

You have shot over.

ORLEANS

'Tis not the first time you were overshot.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

My lord high constable, the English lie withinfifteen hundred paces of your tents.

Constable

Who hath measured the ground?

Messenger

The Lord Grandpre.

Constable

A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it wereday! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not forthe dawning as we do.

ORLEANS

What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king ofEngland, to mope with his fat-brained followers sofar out of his knowledge!

Constable

If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.

ORLEANS

That they lack; for if their heads had anyintellectual armour, they could never wear such heavyhead-pieces.

RAMBURES

That island of England breeds very valiantcreatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

ORLEANS

Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of aRussian bear and have their heads crushed likerotten apples! You may as well say, that's avaliant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.

Constable

Just, just; and the men do sympathize with themastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leavingtheir wits with their wives: and then give themgreat meals of beef and iron and steel, they willeat like wolves and fight like devils.

ORLEANS

Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.

Constable

Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachsto eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:come, shall we about it?

ORLEANS

It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by tenWe shall have each a hundred Englishmen.Exeunt

ACT IV
PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus


Chorus

Now entertain conjecture of a timeWhen creeping murmur and the poring darkFills the wide vessel of the universe.From camp to camp through the foul womb of nightThe hum of either army stilly sounds,That the fixed sentinels almost receiveThe secret whispers of each other's watch:Fire answers fire, and through their paly flamesEach battle sees the other's umber'd face;Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighsPiercing the night's dull ear, and from the tentsThe armourers, accomplishing the knights,With busy hammers closing rivets up,Give dreadful note of preparation:The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,And the third hour of drowsy morning name.Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,The confident and over-lusty FrenchDo the low-rated English play at dice;And chide the cripple tardy-gaited nightWho, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limpSo tediously away. The poor condemned English,Like sacrifices, by their watchful firesSit patiently and inly ruminateThe morning's danger, and their gesture sadInvesting lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coatsPresenteth them unto the gazing moonSo many horrid ghosts. O now, who will beholdThe royal captain of this ruin'd bandWalking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'For forth he goes and visits all his host.Bids them good morrow with a modest smileAnd calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.Upon his royal face there is no noteHow dread an army hath enrounded him;Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colourUnto the weary and all-watched night,But freshly looks and over-bears attaintWith cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;That every wretch, pining and pale before,Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:A largess universal like the sunHis liberal eye doth give to every one,Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,Behold, as may unworthiness define,A little touch of Harry in the night.And so our scene must to the battle fly;Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgraceWith four or five most vile and ragged foils,Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,Minding true things by what their mockeries be.Exit

SCENE I. The English camp at Agincourt.

Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER


KING HENRY V

Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;The greater therefore should our courage be.Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!There is some soul of goodness in things evil,Would men observingly distil it out.For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,Which is both healthful and good husbandry:Besides, they are our outward consciences,And preachers to us all, admonishingThat we should dress us fairly for our end.Thus may we gather honey from the weed,And make a moral of the devil himself.Enter ERPINGHAM
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:A good soft pillow for that good white headWere better than a churlish turf of France.

ERPINGHAM

Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'

KING HENRY V

'Tis good for men to love their present painsUpon example; so the spirit is eased:And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,The organs, though defunct and dead before,Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,With casted slough and fresh legerity.Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,Commend me to the princes in our camp;Do my good morrow to them, and anonDesire them an to my pavilion.

GLOUCESTER

We shall, my liege.

ERPINGHAM

Shall I attend your grace?

KING HENRY V

No, my good knight;Go with my brothers to my lords of England:I and my bosom must debate awhile,And then I would no other company.

Trail'st thou the puissant pike?

KING HENRY V

Even so. What are you?

PISTOL

As good a gentleman as the emperor.

KING HENRY V

Then you are a better than the king.

FLUELLEN

So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It isthe greatest admiration of the universal world, whenthe true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of thewars is not kept: if you would take the pains but toexamine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shallfind, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddlenor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and thecares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobrietyof it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.

GOWER

Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.

FLUELLEN

If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a pratingcoxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,look you, be an ass and a fool and a pratingcoxcomb? in your own conscience, now?

COURT

Brother John Bates, is not that the morning whichbreaks yonder?

BATES

I think it be: but we have no great cause to desirethe approach of day.

WILLIAMS

We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I thinkwe shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?

KING HENRY V

A friend.

WILLIAMS

Under what captain serve you?

KING HENRY V

Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

WILLIAMS

A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: Ipray you, what thinks he of our estate?

KING HENRY V

Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to bewashed off the next tide.

BATES

He hath not told his thought to the king?

KING HENRY V

No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though Ispeak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as Iam: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: theelement shows to him as it doth to me; all hissenses have but human conditions: his ceremonieslaid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; andthough his affections are higher mounted than ours,yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the likewing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as wedo, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relishas ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possesshim with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showingit, should dishearten his army.

BATES

He may show what outward courage he will; but Ibelieve, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wishhimself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would hewere, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.

KING HENRY V

By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:I think he would not wish himself any where butwhere he is.

BATES

Then I would he were here alone; so should he besure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.

KING HENRY V

I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him herealone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men'sminds: methinks I could not die any where socontented as in the king's company; his cause beingjust and his quarrel honourable.

WILLIAMS

That's more than we know.

BATES

Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we knowenough, if we know we are the kings subjects: ifhis cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipesthe crime of it out of us.

WILLIAMS

But if the cause be not good, the king himself hatha heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs andarms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall jointogether at the latter day and cry all 'We died atsuch a place;' some swearing, some crying for asurgeon, some upon their wives left poor behindthem, some upon the debts they owe, some upon theirchildren rawly left. I am afeard there are few diewell that die in a battle; for how can theycharitably dispose of any thing, when blood is theirargument? Now, if these men do not die well, itwill be a black matter for the king that led them toit; whom to disobey were against all proportion ofsubjection.

KING HENRY V

So, if a son that is by his father sent aboutmerchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, theimputation of his wickedness by your rule, should beimposed upon his father that sent him: or if aservant, under his master's command transporting asum of money, be assailed by robbers and die inmany irreconciled iniquities, you may call thebusiness of the master the author of the servant'sdamnation: but this is not so: the king is notbound to answer the particular endings of hissoldiers, the father of his son, nor the master ofhis servant; for they purpose not their death, whenthey purpose their services. Besides, there is noking, be his cause never so spotless, if it come tothe arbitrement of swords, can try it out with allunspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on themthe guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals ofperjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, thathave before gored the gentle bosom of peace withpillage and robbery. Now, if these men havedefeated the law and outrun native punishment,though they can outstrip men, they have no wings tofly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;so that here men are punished for before-breach ofthe king's laws in now the king's quarrel: wherethey feared the death, they have borne life away;and where they would be safe, they perish: then ifthey die unprovided, no more is the king guilty oftheir damnation than he was before guilty of thoseimpieties for the which they are now visited. Everysubject's duty is the king's; but every subject'ssoul is his own. Therefore should every soldier inthe wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash everymote out of his conscience: and dying so, deathis to him advantage; or not dying, the time wasblessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:and in him that escapes, it were not sin to thinkthat, making God so free an offer, He let himoutlive that day to see His greatness and to teachothers how they should prepare.

WILLIAMS

'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill uponhis own head, the king is not to answer it.

BATES

But I do not desire he should answer for me; andyet I determine to fight lustily for him.

KING HENRY V

I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.

WILLIAMS

Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: butwhen our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and wene'er the wiser.

KING HENRY V

If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.

WILLIAMS

You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of anelder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure cando against a monarch! you may as well go about toturn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with apeacock's feather. You'll never trust his wordafter! come, 'tis a foolish saying.

KING HENRY V

Your reproof is something too round: I should beangry with you, if the time were convenient.

WILLIAMS

Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

KING HENRY V

I embrace it.

WILLIAMS

How shall I know thee again?

KING HENRY V

Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in mybonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, Iwill make it my quarrel.

WILLIAMS

Here's my glove: give me another of thine.

KING HENRY V

There.

WILLIAMS

This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou cometo me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.

KING HENRY V

If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

WILLIAMS

Thou darest as well be hanged.

KING HENRY V

Well. I will do it, though I take thee in theking's company.

WILLIAMS

Keep thy word: fare thee well.

BATES

Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we haveFrench quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.

KING HENRY V

Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns toone, they will beat us; for they bear them on theirshoulders: but it is no English treason to cutFrench crowns, and to-morrow the king himself willbe a clipper.Exeunt soldiers
Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,Our debts, our careful wives,Our children and our sins lay on the king!We must bear all.

What infinite heart's-easeMust kings neglect, that private men enjoy!And what have kings, that privates have not too,Save ceremony, save general ceremony?And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st moreOf mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?O ceremony, show me but thy worth!What is thy soul of adoration?Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,Creating awe and fear in other men?Wherein thou art less happy being fear'dThan they in fearing.What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!Think'st thou the fiery fever will go outWith titles blown from adulation?Will it give place to flexure and low bending?Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;I am a king that find thee, and I know'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,The farced title running 'fore the king,The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pompThat beats upon the high shore of this world,No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,Not all these, laid in bed majestical,Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,Who with a body fill'd and vacant mindGets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,But, like a lackey, from the rise to setSweats in the eye of Phoebus and all nightSleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,And follows so the ever-running year,With profitable labour, to his grave:And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.The slave, a member of the country's peace,Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wotsWhat watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,Whose hours the peasant best advantages.Enter ERPINGHAM


ERPINGHAM

My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,Seek through your camp to find you.

KING HENRY V

Good old knight,Collect them all together at my tent:I'll be before thee.

ERPINGHAM

I shall do't, my lord.Exit


KING HENRY V

O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;Possess them not with fear; take from them nowThe sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbersPluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,O, not to-day, think not upon the faultMy father made in compassing the crown!I Richard's body have interred anew;And on it have bestow'd more contrite tearsThan from it issued forced drops of blood:Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold upToward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have builtTwo chantries, where the sad and solemn priestsSing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;Though all that I can do is nothing worth,Since that my penitence comes after all,Imploring pardon.Enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

My liege!

KING HENRY V

My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;I know thy errand, I will go with thee:The day, my friends and all things stay for me.Exeunt

SCENE II. The French camp.

Enter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others


ORLEANS

The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!

DAUPHIN

Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!

ORLEANS

O brave spirit!

DAUPHIN

Via! les eaux et la terre.

ORLEANS

Rien puis? L'air et la feu.

DAUPHIN

Ciel, cousin Orleans.Enter Constable
Now, my lord constable!

Constable

Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!

DAUPHIN

Mount them, and make incision in their hides,That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

RAMBURES

What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?Enter Messenger


Messenger

The English are embattled, you French peers.

Constable

To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!Do but behold yon poor and starved band,And your fair show shall suck away their souls,Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.There is not work enough for all our hands;Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veinsTo give each naked curtle-axe a stain,That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,Who in unnecessary action swarmAbout our squares of battle, were enowTo purge this field of such a hilding foe,Though we upon this mountain's basis byTook stand for idle speculation:But that our honours must not. What's to say?A very little little let us do.And all is done. Then let the trumpets soundThe tucket sonance and the note to mount;For our approach shall so much dare the fieldThat England shall couch down in fear and yield.Enter GRANDPRE


GRANDPRE

Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,Ill-favouredly become the morning field:Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,And our air shakes them passing scornfully:Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd hostAnd faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jadesLob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyesAnd in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bitLies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;And their executors, the knavish crows,Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.Description cannot suit itself in wordsTo demonstrate the life of such a battleIn life so lifeless as it shows itself.

Constable

They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.

DAUPHIN

Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suitsAnd give their fasting horses provender,And after fight with them?

Constable

I stay but for my guidon: to the field!I will the banner from a trumpet take,And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!The sun is high, and we outwear the day.Exeunt

SCENE III. The English camp.

Enter GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND


GLOUCESTER

Where is the king?

BEDFORD

The king himself is rode to view their battle.

WESTMORELAND

Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.

EXETER

There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.

SALISBURY

God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!

BEDFORD

Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!

EXETER

Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.Exit SALISBURY


BEDFORD

He is full of valour as of kindness;Princely in both.Enter the KING


WESTMORELAND

                  O that we now had hereBut one ten thousand of those men in EnglandThat do no work to-day!

KING HENRY V

What's he that wishes so?My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:If we are mark'd to die, we are enowTo do our country loss; and if to live,The fewer men, the greater share of honour.God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;It yearns me not if men my garments wear;Such outward things dwell not in my desires:But if it be a sin to covet honour,I am the most offending soul alive.No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:God's peace! I would not lose so great an honourAs one man more, methinks, would share from meFor the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,That he which hath no stomach to this fight,Let him depart; his passport shall be madeAnd crowns for convoy put into his purse:We would not die in that man's companyThat fears his fellowship to die with us.This day is called the feast of Crispian:He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,And rouse him at the name of Crispian.He that shall live this day, and see old age,Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,But he'll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day: then shall our names.Familiar in his mouth as household wordsHarry the king, Bedford and Exeter,Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.This story shall the good man teach his son;And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be remember'd;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;For he to-day that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition:And gentlemen in England now a-bedShall think themselves accursed they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.Re-enter SALISBURY


SALISBURY

My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:The French are bravely in their battles set,And will with all expedience charge on us.

KING HENRY V

All things are ready, if our minds be so.

WESTMORELAND

Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

KING HENRY V

Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

WESTMORELAND

God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,Without more help, could fight this royal battle!

KING HENRY V

Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;Which likes me better than to wish us one.You know your places: God be with you all!Tucket. Enter MONTJOY


MONTJOY

Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,Before thy most assured overthrow:For certainly thou art so near the gulf,Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,The constable desires thee thou wilt mindThy followers of repentance; that their soulsMay make a peaceful and a sweet retireFrom off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodiesMust lie and fester.

KING HENRY V

Who hath sent thee now?

MONTJOY

The Constable of France.

KING HENRY V

I pray thee, bear my former answer back:Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?The man that once did sell the lion's skinWhile the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.A many of our bodies shall no doubtFind native graves; upon the which, I trust,Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:And those that leave their valiant bones in France,Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.Mark then abounding valour in our English,That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,Break out into a second course of mischief,Killing in relapse of mortality.Let me speak proudly: tell the constableWe are but warriors for the working-day;Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'dWith rainy marching in the painful field;There's not a piece of feather in our host--Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--And time hath worn us into slovenry:But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere nightThey'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluckThe gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' headsAnd turn them out of service. If they do this,--As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom thenWill soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,Shall yield them little, tell the constable.

MONTJOY

I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:Thou never shalt hear herald any more.Exit


KING HENRY V

I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.Enter YORK


YORK

My lord, most humbly on my knee I begThe leading of the vaward.

KING HENRY V

Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!Exeunt

Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.

PISTOL

Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?what is thy name? discuss.

French Soldier

O Seigneur Dieu!

PISTOL

O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,Except, O signieur, thou do give to meEgregious ransom.

French Soldier

O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!

PISTOL

Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throatIn drops of crimson blood.

French Soldier

Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?

PISTOL

Brass, cur!Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,Offer'st me brass?

French Soldier

O pardonnez moi!

PISTOL

Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in FrenchWhat is his name.

Boy

Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?

French Soldier

Monsieur le Fer.

Boy

He says his name is Master Fer.

PISTOL

Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferrethim: discuss the same in French unto him.

Boy

I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.

PISTOL

Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.

French Soldier

Que dit-il, monsieur?

Boy

Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vouspret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cetteheure de couper votre gorge.

PISTOL

Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.

French Soldier

O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, mepardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.

PISTOL

What are his words?

Boy

He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman ofa good house; and for his ransom he will give youtwo hundred crowns.

PISTOL

Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.

French Soldier

Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

Boy

Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonneraucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vousl'avez promis, il est content de vous donner laliberte, le franchisement.

French Soldier

Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; etje m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre lesmains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.

PISTOL

Expound unto me, boy.

Boy

He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; andhe esteems himself happy that he hath fallen intothe hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.

PISTOL

As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.Follow me!

Boy

Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier
I did never know so full a voice issue from soempty a heart: but the saying is true 'The emptyvessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nymhad ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'the old play, that every one may pare his nails witha wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and sowould this be, if he durst steal any thingadventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, withthe luggage of our camp: the French might have agood prey of us, if he knew of it; for there isnone to guard it but boys.Exit

SCENE V. Another part of the field.

Enter Constable, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES


Constable

O diable!

ORLEANS

O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!

DAUPHIN

Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!Reproach and everlasting shameSits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!Do not run away.A short alarum


Constable

                  Why, all our ranks are broke.

DAUPHIN

O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?

ORLEANS

Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?

BOURBON

Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!Let us die in honour: once more back again;And he that will not follow Bourbon now,Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,Like a base pander, hold the chamber-doorWhilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,His fairest daughter is contaminated.

Constable

Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now!Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

ORLEANS

We are enow yet living in the fieldTo smother up the English in our throngs,If any order might be thought upon.

BOURBON

The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:Let life be short; else shame will be too long.Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another part of the field.

Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces, EXETER, and others


KING HENRY V

Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.

EXETER

The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

KING HENRY V

Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hourI saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;From helmet to the spur all blood he was.

EXETER

In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashesThat bloodily did spawn upon his face;And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,As in this glorious and well-foughten fieldWe kept together in our chivalry!'Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,Commend my service to me sovereign.'So did he turn and over Suffolk's neckHe threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'dA testament of noble-ending love.The pretty and sweet manner of it forcedThose waters from me which I would have stopp'd;But I had not so much of man in me,And all my mother came into mine eyesAnd gave me up to tears.

KING HENRY V

I blame you not;For, hearing this, I must perforce compoundWith mistful eyes, or they will issue too.Alarum
But, hark! what new alarum is this same?The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:Then every soldier kill his prisoners:Give the word through.Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER


FLUELLEN

Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expresslyagainst the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece ofknavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in yourconscience, now, is it not?

GOWER

'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and thecowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' donethis slaughter: besides, they have burned andcarried away all that was in the king's tent;wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused everysoldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis agallant king!

FLUELLEN

Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. Whatcall you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!

GOWER

Alexander the Great.

FLUELLEN

Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or thegreat, or the mighty, or the huge, or themagnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phraseis a little variations.

GOWER

I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; hisfather was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.

FLUELLEN

I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. Itell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisonsbetween Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,look you, is both alike. There is a river inMacedon; and there is also moreover a river atMonmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it isout of my prains what is the name of the otherriver; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers isto my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If youmark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's lifeis come after it indifferent well; for there isfigures in all things. Alexander, God knows, andyou know, in his rages, and his furies, and hiswraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and hisdispleasures, and his indignations, and also being alittle intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales andhis angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

GOWER

Our king is not like him in that: he never killedany of his friends.

FLUELLEN

It is not well done, mark you now take the tales outof my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speakbut in the figures and comparisons of it: asAlexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in hisales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being inhis right wits and his good judgments, turned awaythe fat knight with the great belly-doublet: hewas full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, andmocks; I have forgot his name.

GOWER

Sir John Falstaff.

FLUELLEN

That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.

GOWER

Here comes his majesty.Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces; WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others


KING HENRY V

I was not angry since I came to FranceUntil this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:If they will fight with us, bid them come down,Or void the field; they do offend our sight:If they'll do neither, we will come to them,And make them skirr away, as swift as stonesEnforced from the old Assyrian slings:Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,And not a man of them that we shall takeShall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.Enter MONTJOY


EXETER

Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

GLOUCESTER

His eyes are humbler than they used to be.

KING HENRY V

How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou notThat I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?Comest thou again for ransom?

MONTJOY

No, great king:I come to thee for charitable licence,That we may wander o'er this bloody fieldTo look our dead, and then to bury them;To sort our nobles from our common men.For many of our princes--woe the while!--Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbsIn blood of princes; and their wounded steedsFret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rageYerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,To view the field in safety and disposeOf their dead bodies!

KING HENRY V

I tell thee truly, herald,I know not if the day be ours or no;For yet a many of your horsemen peerAnd gallop o'er the field.

MONTJOY

The day is yours.

KING HENRY V

Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?

MONTJOY

They call it Agincourt.

KING HENRY V

Then call we this the field of Agincourt,Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

FLUELLEN

Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please yourmajesty, and your great-uncle Edward the PlackPrince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,fought a most prave pattle here in France.

KING HENRY V

They did, Fluellen.

FLUELLEN

Your majesty says very true: if your majesties isremembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in agarden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in theirMonmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to thishour is an honourable badge of the service; and I dobelieve your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leekupon Saint Tavy's day.

KING HENRY V

I wear it for a memorable honour;For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

FLUELLEN

All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty'sWelsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleaseshis grace, and his majesty too!

KING HENRY V

Thanks, good my countryman.

FLUELLEN

By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care notwho know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: Ineed not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised beGod, so long as your majesty is an honest man.

KING HENRY V

God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:Bring me just notice of the numbers deadOn both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy


EXETER

Soldier, you must come to the king.

KING HENRY V

Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?

WILLIAMS

An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one thatI should fight withal, if he be alive.

KING HENRY V

An Englishman?

WILLIAMS

An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggeredwith me last night; who, if alive and ever dare tochallenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a boxo' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wearif alive, I will strike it out soundly.

KING HENRY V

What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit thissoldier keep his oath?

FLUELLEN

He is a craven and a villain else, an't please yourmajesty, in my conscience.

KING HENRY V

It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,quite from the answer of his degree.

FLUELLEN

Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, asLucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, lookyour grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: ifhe be perjured, see you now, his reputation is asarrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his blackshoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in myconscience, la!

KING HENRY V

Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.

WILLIAMS

So I will, my liege, as I live.

KING HENRY V

Who servest thou under?

WILLIAMS

Under Captain Gower, my liege.

FLUELLEN

Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge andliteratured in the wars.

KING HENRY V

Call him hither to me, soldier.

WILLIAMS

I will, my liege.Exit


KING HENRY V

Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me andstick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself weredown together, I plucked this glove from his helm:if any man challenge this, he is a friend toAlencon, and an enemy to our person; if thouencounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.

FLUELLEN

Your grace doo's me as great honours as can bedesired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fainsee the man, that has but two legs, that shall findhimself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but Iwould fain see it once, an please God of his gracethat I might see.

KING HENRY V

Knowest thou Gower?

FLUELLEN

He is my dear friend, an please you.

KING HENRY V

Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.

FLUELLEN

I will fetch him.Exit


KING HENRY V

My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:The glove which I have given him for a favourMay haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;It is the soldier's; I by bargain shouldWear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:If that the soldier strike him, as I judgeBy his blunt bearing he will keep his word,Some sudden mischief may arise of it;For I do know Fluellen valiantAnd, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,And quickly will return an injury:Follow and see there be no harm between them.Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.Exeunt

Sir, know you this glove?

FLUELLEN

Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.

WILLIAMS

I know this; and thus I challenge it.Strikes him

GOWER

How now, sir! you villain!

WILLIAMS

Do you think I'll be forsworn?

FLUELLEN

Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason hispayment into ploughs, I warrant you.

KING HENRY V

How now! what's the matter?

FLUELLEN

My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,look your grace, has struck the glove which yourmajesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.

WILLIAMS

My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow ofit; and he that I gave it to in change promised towear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if hedid: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and Ihave been as good as my word.

FLUELLEN

Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty'smanhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousyknave it is: I hope your majesty is pear metestimony and witness, and will avouchment, thatthis is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty isgive me; in your conscience, now?

KING HENRY V

Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is thefellow of it.'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

FLUELLEN

An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,if there is any martial law in the world.

KING HENRY V

How canst thou make me satisfaction?

WILLIAMS

All offences, my lord, come from the heart: nevercame any from mine that might offend your majesty.

KING HENRY V

It was ourself thou didst abuse.

WILLIAMS

Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared tome but as a common man; witness the night, yourgarments, your lowliness; and what your highnesssuffered under that shape, I beseech you take it foryour own fault and not mine: for had you been as Itook you for, I made no offence; therefore, Ibeseech your highness, pardon me.

KING HENRY V

Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;And wear it for an honour in thy capTill I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

FLUELLEN

By this day and this light, the fellow has mettleenough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pencefor you; and I pray you to serve Got, and keep youout of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, anddissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.

WILLIAMS

I will none of your money.

FLUELLEN

It is with a good will; I can tell you, it willserve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore shouldyou be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tisa good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.Enter an English Herald


KING HENRY V

Now, herald, are the dead number'd?

Herald

Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.

KING HENRY V

What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?

EXETER

Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

KING HENRY V

This note doth tell me of ten thousand FrenchThat in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,And nobles bearing banners, there lie deadOne hundred twenty six: added to these,Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,And gentlemen of blood and quality.The names of those their nobles that lie dead:Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,The brother of the Duke of Burgundy,And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.Here was a royal fellowship of death!Where is the number of our English dead?Herald shews him another paper
Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:None else of name; and of all other menBut five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;And not to us, but to thy arm alone,Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,But in plain shock and even play of battle,Was ever known so great and little lossOn one part and on the other? Take it, God,For it is none but thine!

EXETER

'Tis wonderful!

KING HENRY V

Come, go we in procession to the village.And be it death proclaimed through our hostTo boast of this or take the praise from GodWhich is his only.

FLUELLEN

Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tellhow many is killed?

KING HENRY V

Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,That God fought for us.

FLUELLEN

Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.

KING HENRY V

Do we all holy rites;Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;'The dead with charity enclosed in clay:And then to Calais; and to England then:Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.Exeunt

Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,That I may prompt them: and of such as have,I humbly pray them to admit the excuseOf time, of numbers and due course of things,Which cannot in their huge and proper lifeBe here presented. Now we bear the kingToward Calais: grant him there; there seen,Heave him away upon your winged thoughtsAthwart the sea. Behold, the English beachPales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the kingSeems to prepare his way: so let him land,And solemnly see him set on to London.So swift a pace hath thought that even nowYou may imagine him upon Blackheath;Where that his lords desire him to have borneHis bruised helmet and his bended swordBefore him through the city: he forbids it,Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;Giving full trophy, signal and ostentQuite from himself to God. But now behold,In the quick forge and working-house of thought,How London doth pour out her citizens!The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,Like to the senators of the antique Rome,With the plebeians swarming at their heels,Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:As, by a lower but loving likelihood,Were now the general of our gracious empress,As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,How many would the peaceful city quit,To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;As yet the lamentation of the FrenchInvites the King of England's stay at home;The emperor's coming in behalf of France,To order peace between them; and omitAll the occurrences, whatever chanced,Till Harry's back-return again to France:There must we bring him; and myself have play'dThe interim, by remembering you 'tis past.Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,After your thoughts, straight back again to France.Exit

I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at mydesires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat,look you, this leek: because, look you, you do notlove it, nor your affections and your appetites andyour digestions doo's not agree with it, I woulddesire you to eat it.

KING HENRY V

Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!Unto our brother France, and to our sister,Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishesTo our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;And, as a branch and member of this royalty,By whom this great assembly is contrived,We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!

KING OF FRANCE

Right joyous are we to behold your face,Most worthy brother England; fairly met:So are you, princes English, every one.

QUEEN ISABEL

So happy be the issue, brother England,Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,As we are now glad to behold your eyes;Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in themAgainst the French, that met them in their bent,The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,Have lost their quality, and that this dayShall change all griefs and quarrels into love.

KING HENRY V

To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

QUEEN ISABEL

You English princes all, I do salute you.

BURGUNDY

My duty to you both, on equal love,Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,To bring your most imperial majestiesUnto this bar and royal interview,Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.Since then my office hath so far prevail'dThat, face to face and royal eye to eye,You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,If I demand, before this royal view,What rub or what impediment there is,Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,Should not in this best garden of the worldOur fertile France, put up her lovely visage?Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,Corrupting in its own fertility.Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leasThe darnel, hemlock and rank fumitoryDoth root upon, while that the coulter rustsThat should deracinate such savagery;The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forthThe freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,Conceives by idleness and nothing teemsBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,Losing both beauty and utility.And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,Even so our houses and ourselves and childrenHave lost, or do not learn for want of time,The sciences that should become our country;But grow like savages,--as soldiers willThat nothing do but meditate on blood,--To swearing and stern looks, diffused attireAnd every thing that seems unnatural.Which to reduce into our former favourYou are assembled: and my speech entreatsThat I may know the let, why gentle PeaceShould not expel these inconveniencesAnd bless us with her former qualities.

KING HENRY V

If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,Whose want gives growth to the imperfectionsWhich you have cited, you must buy that peaceWith full accord to all our just demands;Whose tenors and particular effectsYou have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

BURGUNDY

The king hath heard them; to the which as yetThere is no answer made.

KING HENRY V

Well then the peace,Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.

KING OF FRANCE

I have but with a cursorary eyeO'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your graceTo appoint some of your council presentlyTo sit with us once more, with better heedTo re-survey them, we will suddenlyPass our accept and peremptory answer.

KING HENRY V

Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;And take with you free power to ratify,Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms bestShall see advantageable for our dignity,Any thing in or out of our demands,And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,Go with the princes, or stay here with us?

QUEEN ISABEL

Our gracious brother, I will go with them:Haply a woman's voice may do some good,When articles too nicely urged be stood on.

KING HENRY V

Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:She is our capital demand, comprisedWithin the fore-rank of our articles.

QUEEN ISABEL

She hath good leave.Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE


KING HENRY V

Fair Katharine, and most fair,Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier termsSuch as will enter at a lady's earAnd plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

KATHARINE

Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.

KING HENRY V

O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly withyour French heart, I will be glad to hear youconfess it brokenly with your English tongue. Doyou like me, Kate?

KATHARINE

Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'

KING HENRY V

An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.

KATHARINE

Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?

ALICE

Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.

KING HENRY V

I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush toaffirm it.

KATHARINE

O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines detromperies.

KING HENRY V

What says she, fair one? that the tongues of menare full of deceits?

ALICE

Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full ofdeceits: dat is de princess.

KING HENRY V

The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I amglad thou canst speak no better English; for, ifthou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain kingthat thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy mycrown. I know no ways to mince it in love, butdirectly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge mefarther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear outmy suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and soclap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?

KATHARINE

Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.

KING HENRY V

Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance foryour sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, Ihave neither words nor measure, and for the other, Ihave no strength in measure, yet a reasonablemeasure in strength. If I could win a lady atleap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with myarmour on my back, under the correction of braggingbe it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horsefor her favours, I could lay on like a butcher andsit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out myeloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,nor never break for urging. If thou canst love afellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worthsun-burning, that never looks in his glass for loveof any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thycook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canstlove me for this, take me: if not, to say to theethat I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by theLord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thoulivest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain anduncoined constancy; for he perforce must do theeright, because he hath not the gift to woo in otherplaces: for these fellows of infinite tongue, thatcan rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they doalways reason themselves out again. What! aspeaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. Agood leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; ablack beard will turn white; a curled pate will growbald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will waxhollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and themoon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for itshines bright and never changes, but keeps hiscourse truly. If thou would have such a one, takeme; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

KATHARINE

Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?

KING HENRY V

No; it is not possible you should love the enemy ofFrance, Kate: but, in loving me, you should lovethe friend of France; for I love France so well thatI will not part with a village of it; I will have itall mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I amyours, then yours is France and you are mine.

KATHARINE

I cannot tell vat is dat.

KING HENRY V

No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I amsure will hang upon my tongue like a new-marriedwife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shookoff. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quandvous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, whatthen? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre estFrance et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so muchmore French: I shall never move thee in French,unless it be to laugh at me.

KATHARINE

Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, ilest meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.

KING HENRY V

No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of mytongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needsbe granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thouunderstand thus much English, canst thou love me?

KATHARINE

I cannot tell.

KING HENRY V

Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll askthem. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,when you come into your closet, you'll question thisgentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will toher dispraise those parts in me that you love withyour heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; therather, gentle princess, because I love theecruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have asaving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I getthee with scambling, and thou must therefore needsprove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound aboy, half French, half English, that shall go toConstantinople and take the Turk by the beard?shall we not? what sayest thou, my fairflower-de-luce?

KATHARINE

I do not know dat

KING HENRY V

No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: dobut now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for yourFrench part of such a boy; and for my English moietytake the word of a king and a bachelor. How answeryou, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cheret devin deesse?

KATHARINE

Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive demost sage demoiselle dat is en France.

KING HENRY V

Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, intrue English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour Idare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins toflatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poorand untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrewmy father's ambition! he was thinking of civil warswhen he got me: therefore was I created with astubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, whenI come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up ofbeauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thouhast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thoushalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will youhave me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch thethoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I amthine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mineear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England isthine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and HarryPlantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it beforehis face, if he be not fellow with the best king,thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice ismusic and thy English broken; therefore, queen ofall, Katharine, break thy mind to me in brokenEnglish; wilt thou have me?

KATHARINE

Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.

KING HENRY V

Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall pleasehim, Kate.

KATHARINE

Den it sall also content me.

KING HENRY V

Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.

KATHARINE

Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, jene veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur enbaisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigneserviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, montres-puissant seigneur.

KING HENRY V

Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

KATHARINE

Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devantleur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.

KING HENRY V

Madam my interpreter, what says she?

ALICE

Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies ofFrance,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.

KING HENRY V

To kiss.

ALICE

Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.

KING HENRY V

It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kissbefore they are married, would she say?

ALICE

Oui, vraiment.

KING HENRY V

O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. DearKate, you and I cannot be confined within the weaklist of a country's fashion: we are the makers ofmanners, Kate; and the liberty that follows ourplaces stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I willdo yours, for upholding the nice fashion of yourcountry in denying me a kiss: therefore, patientlyand yielding.Kissing her
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there ismore eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in thetongues of the French council; and they shouldsooner persuade Harry of England than a generalpetition of monarchs. Here comes your father.Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords


BURGUNDY

God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach youour princess English?

KING HENRY V

I would have her learn, my fair cousin, howperfectly I love her; and that is good English.

BURGUNDY

Is she not apt?

KING HENRY V

Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is notsmooth; so that, having neither the voice nor theheart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure upthe spirit of love in her, that he will appear inhis true likeness.

BURGUNDY

Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer youfor that. If you would conjure in her, you mustmake a circle; if conjure up love in her in his truelikeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can youblame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with thevirgin crimson of modesty, if she deny theappearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeingself? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maidto consign to.

KING HENRY V

Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.

BURGUNDY

They are then excused, my lord, when they see notwhat they do.

KING HENRY V

Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.

BURGUNDY

I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you willteach her to know my meaning: for maids, wellsummered and warm kept, are like flies atBartholomew-tide, blind, though they have theireyes; and then they will endure handling, whichbefore would not abide looking on.

KING HENRY V

This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in thelatter end and she must be blind too.

BURGUNDY

As love is, my lord, before it loves.

KING HENRY V

It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love formy blindness, who cannot see many a fair French cityfor one fair French maid that stands in my way.

FRENCH KING

Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the citiesturned into a maid; for they are all girdled withmaiden walls that war hath never entered.

KING HENRY V

Shall Kate be my wife?

FRENCH KING

So please you.

KING HENRY V

I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of maywait on her: so the maid that stood in the way formy wish shall show me the way to my will.

FRENCH KING

We have consented to all terms of reason.

KING HENRY V

Is't so, my lords of England?

WESTMORELAND

The king hath granted every article:His daughter first, and then in sequel all,According to their firm proposed natures.

EXETER

Only he hath not yet subscribed this:Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,having any occasion to write for matter of grant,shall name your highness in this form and with thisaddition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roid'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus inLatin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, RexAngliae, et Haeres Franciae.

FRENCH KING

Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,But your request shall make me let it pass.

KING HENRY V

I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,Let that one article rank with the rest;And thereupon give me your daughter.

FRENCH KING

Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise upIssue to me; that the contending kingdomsOf France and England, whose very shores look paleWith envy of each other's happiness,May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunctionPlant neighbourhood and Christian-like accordIn their sweet bosoms, that never war advanceHis bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.

ALL

Amen!

KING HENRY V

Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.Flourish


QUEEN ISABEL

God, the best maker of all marriages,Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!As man and wife, being two, are one in love,So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,To make divorce of their incorporate league;That English may as French, French Englishmen,Receive each other. God speak this Amen!

ALL

Amen!

KING HENRY V

Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!Sennet. Exeunt
